People say to me that being a copy pasterino master is Impossible and I'm *** retarded but I don't care,im beautiful. I'm observing singsing strim masters and their spam techniques for months. From now on I want you guys to call me "Pasterino Enthusiast" and respect my right to copy pasta any text i want. Thank you for being so understanding.
