2015-03-13 02:22:36	@nizcast	i'm of the belief that every hero is viable, some just need a little more help than others Kappa
2015-03-13 02:22:57	fortytwo322	no ability to farm jungle, escape isn't good enough to farm lane without constant babysitting
2015-03-13 02:23:05	strikerromanov	yeah but i meant that spectre start to escalate quickly from min 30-
2015-03-13 02:23:19	fortytwo322	it seems like spectre's sole source of income is using haunt to ks in ganks

2015-03-13 02:24:09	ziniannainiz	Shouldn't you just work on buffing spec herself?

2015-03-13 02:25:31	@nizcast	i dont really want to see heroes get much better. Just do something to the big 6 or 7 right now. Theres too many heroes that are just out of control
2015-03-13 02:25:48	fortytwo322	i also think we should give anti-mage a minor buff

2015-03-13 02:26:26	strikerromanov	more likely you see troll on every game , and the fact is that he's being used not even cause of changes
2015-03-13 02:26:31	ziniannainiz	lol, the re-nerf to sniper and/or MoM in general might be coming. But I mean, this is just as stale as the old "Void, WD, Skywrath Doom" days.....

2015-03-13 02:26:58	fortytwo322	meh, i think AM's real pitfall is that mana break is an orb
2015-03-13 02:27:08	fortytwo322	let him buy skadi, for instance.... Kappa
2015-03-13 02:27:22	@nizcast	MoM is getting nerfed for sure. Was talking with indiebear the other night and we both agree its the mana cost that is going to take the hit
2015-03-13 02:27:29	@nizcast	he thinks from 25 to 100.. i think 75
2015-03-13 02:27:33	fortytwo322	mana cost? i figured it would be the cooldown

2015-03-13 02:27:49	ziniannainiz	:(
2015-03-13 02:28:08	@nizcast	so you give void some int growth or base int
2015-03-13 02:28:08	strikerromanov	void is alright imo, enoying , but balanced
2015-03-13 02:28:13	@nizcast	it doesnt change him much
2015-03-13 02:28:22	ziniannainiz	IDK, just my perception. I feel like I am always scraping for that last 5 mana on him all the time.

2015-03-13 02:29:11	strikerromanov	i buy on him ring of aquila that is more than enought to actually have mana
2015-03-13 02:29:11	fortytwo322	i think a cooldown nerf is better than a mana cost nerf; won't fuck void over as hard but will still seriously cut its usefulness as a farm expediator, which is why it's so insane right now
2015-03-13 02:29:32	fortytwo322	a significant increase to the price of MoM could also be a good nerf
2015-03-13 02:29:40	@nizcast	that could work too (the cd)

2015-03-13 02:38:38	@cat6669	twitch can fuck themselves
2015-03-13 02:38:39	aydin690	do partners get paid for views too?

2015-03-13 02:42:47	@cat6669	a lot of people dislike me and no one ever asks me questions they just make assumptions
2015-03-13 02:43:34	aydin690	you used to be 2edgy for the average twitch viewer
2015-03-13 02:43:51	@nizcast	i think part of it is the "type" of people that watch girl streamers. And I mean this in the most respectful way possible, but they are watchign a chick for a reason. And that reason doesnt apply when they are watching a dude
2015-03-13 02:43:52	@cat6669	but why hate me cus u think i use tumblr
2015-03-13 02:43:56	@cat6669	which i havent in 6 years lmao
2015-03-13 02:44:11	@cat6669	ya its just gay as hell to be resented for not being basic
2015-03-13 02:44:33	@nizcast	it's just silly.
2015-03-13 02:45:09	aydin690	i dont think anybody actually hates you
2015-03-13 02:45:20	@nizcast	I don't want to hate on another stream or anything. But http://www.twitch.tv/jennythesquirrel (shes not live right now) being able to stream how she does, and you getting banned for little things just doesnt make sense
2015-03-13 02:45:30	@cat6669	what does she do
2015-03-13 02:45:33	@cat6669	idk who that is
2015-03-13 02:45:51	aydin690	korean lol streamer
2015-03-13 02:45:55	@cat6669	idk if you make twitch money u can do whatever u want
2015-03-13 02:46:02	aydin690	her webcam is basically in her shirt
2015-03-13 02:46:13	@cat6669	if youre satirical and mock the system and dont make twitch money you're plagued with bans
2015-03-13 02:46:18	@nizcast	she has her camera mounted really high and looking down on her tits. Wearing a skimpy dress.
2015-03-13 02:46:35	@nizcast	Her tits are clearly pushed way the fuck up, and she even puts makeup on them
2015-03-13 02:46:39	aydin690	not going to mention tarababcock?
2015-03-13 02:46:43	aydin690	or kneecoleslaw?
2015-03-13 02:46:46	@nizcast	its just so far beyond my understanding of the line of acceptable on twitch
2015-03-13 02:47:00	@cat6669	it doesnt matter cus theyre partnered and make twitch money
2015-03-13 02:47:08	@nizcast	i just brought up jenny because my 2 friends mention her all the fucking time
2015-03-13 02:48:03	@cat6669	its whatever cus ill never make sense of it
2015-03-13 02:48:07	@nizcast	i'm all for people putting on a show in their own way. But at the same time, this is a gaming site and that shoul dbe the focus in some way. People shouldn't be watching you because your tits are half hanging out.
2015-03-13 02:48:23	@cat6669	yeah idk why KristiPlays is allowed to do shit
2015-03-13 02:48:30	@cat6669	shes just someones fuckin ragdoll
2015-03-13 02:48:38	@cat6669	theres no way she figured out streaming shit etc on her own

2015-03-13 02:48:58	@nizcast	There are some good girl streamers, but the vats majority... Ican't watch for more than 30 seconds regardless of how attractive they are

2015-03-13 02:49:30	strikerromanov	ive just read all that

2015-03-13 02:49:46	@cat6669	idk im not a boy so i dont understand the concept of female streams
2015-03-13 02:49:56	@cat6669	besides the fact that 3/4 of them are annoying as fuck
2015-03-13 02:50:01	@cat6669	i respect the hustle and theyre success
2015-03-13 02:50:04	@cat6669	their*
2015-03-13 02:50:05	strikerromanov	well the bans are quite awfull , people do w/e they want to ruin everybody's like just cause they  didnt or cant sucess
2015-03-13 02:50:14	@cat6669	but doesnt take away from the fact theyre toxic people

2015-03-13 02:51:00	strikerromanov	well kneekolin did go off nude cam to switch full time streamer , but that doeesnt make sense for me
2015-03-13 02:51:23	@nizcast	but, i agree. You have to respect what they have done and the communities they have created. It's not easy.

2015-03-13 02:52:38	@nizcast	I think it's important to always be you, but that also doesnt mean that you cant have a character that you are on stream. It's just effectively an extension of you, but an extension that you wouldnt be in public
2015-03-13 02:53:36	@nizcast	that quote
2015-03-13 02:53:37	@cat6669	ive had a lot of self esteem related shit growing up, like ive hated myself almost my entire life except for 2011-2012 and the past 9 months or so
2015-03-13 02:53:38	strikerromanov	be you is really important but we have t oaccept that we're chaning constanly , and some facts can  change us in good way or bad way all the time

2015-03-13 02:54:47	@nizcast	be you, because thats who you are
2015-03-13 02:54:49	strikerromanov	im one who isnt , that doesnt change a fact that i'd be a good person or that i couldnt hang out
2015-03-13 02:54:55	@cat6669	yeah its always been fine, just not lucrative in a way that would make my life better/easier (monetarily)
2015-03-13 02:55:44	@cat6669	it feels good not compromising myself entirely to be a whimsical cocksucking baby on twitch but at the same time makes it hard for me to want to keep pursuing it

2015-03-13 02:57:23	@nizcast	i think you have built a community of people here, and they are here because you are who you are and aren't the kind of girl streamer you are refering to

2015-06-28 22:55:24	jsoh	If you want to make your own necropants (literally; nábrók) you have to get permission from a living man to use his skin after his death.After he has been buried you must dig up his body and flay the skin of the corpse in one piece from the waist down. As soon as you step into the pants they will stick to your own skin. A coin must be stolen from a poor widow and placed in the scrotum along with the magical sign, nábrókarstafur, written on a piece of paper. Consequently the coin will draw money into the scrotum so it will never be empty, as long as the original coin is not removed. To ensure salvation the owner has to convince someone else to overtake the pants and step into each leg as soon as he gets out of it. The necropants will thus keep the money-gathering nature for generations.

2015-06-29 00:39:11	alexdmk	@Mrcizzo A province I don't live in elected an official that has no impact on where I live, and you choose to pass judgement on me for that? Well played.
2015-06-29 00:39:29	mrcizzo	get the cheese curds out of your ears kiddo
2015-06-29 00:39:32	sirgooficus	I'm really tired of everythingh
2015-06-29 00:39:36	sirgooficus	i just want to sleep till Ti
2015-06-29 00:39:46	mrcizzo	SirGooficus, you'll just be tired of TI by then
2015-06-29 00:39:52	alexdmk	@Mrcizzo That would be Quebec that likes poutine, which has cheese curds in it. Once again, not my province.
2015-06-29 00:40:01	eroqin	If you wake up instead of sleeping and sleep instead of waking up, then you can travel back in time to TI4.
2015-06-29 00:40:34	alexdmk	@Mrcizzo Keep on going though, you're coming off as incredibly intelligent.
2015-06-29 00:40:53	eroqin	Sentries are too expensive.

2015-06-29 00:41:47	mythicallotus	Hi
2015-06-29 00:42:37	danggit_smee	dust is also never worth the money
2015-06-29 00:43:26	alexdmk	@Mrcizzo It's clear, based on your correspondence with me, you're the type to insult and attack things without any context or knowledge of the situation at hand. Which is ironic, as that sort of misinformed ignorance is  the primary cause of racism in the first place (your initial issue). Once again, well played.
2015-06-29 00:43:38	eroqin	Look at all that shit I'm not reading.
2015-06-29 00:43:42	jsoh	rob ford was elected to municipal government and also everyone likes poutine alexdmk you are a moron

2015-06-29 00:45:30	east718	time for the ten man circlejerk in mid line PogChamp
2015-06-29 00:45:32	alexdmk	@jsoh What points are you making that makes me a moron? I stated the province elected an official. Being elected to  municipal government would make you an official. And I never said anything about disliking poutine. 
2015-06-29 00:45:56	madic74	I think being gay is just some type of Cancer that people are diseased with Kappa
2015-06-29 00:46:06	jsoh	the province does not elect a municipal government official, moron. 
2015-06-29 00:46:18	alexdmk	Anytime you're in government, you're an "official".
2015-06-29 00:46:34	uber_pro	you think im joking?
2015-06-29 00:46:38	uber_pro	i got 2 tickets
2015-06-29 00:46:39	rkn_fry	may i have a nip sneak peek a boo ? please senpai cat i nearly have to leave for work :P
2015-06-29 00:46:52	eroqin	Being gay is the opposite of cancer.
2015-06-29 00:47:06	eroqin	Because unlike most straight people, gays don't reproduce as uncontrollably.
2015-06-29 00:47:17	alexdmk	"An official is someone who holds an office (function or mandate, regardless whether it carries an actual working space with it) in an organization or government and participates in the exercise of authority (either his own or that of his superior and/or employer, public or legally private)."
2015-06-29 00:47:27	mrcizzo	kill me.
2015-06-29 00:47:30	jsoh	that was nothing to do with anything , moron
2015-06-29 00:47:37	alexdmk	That was your entire point.
2015-06-29 00:47:54	epiclemonaid	hey cat whats going on?
2015-06-29 00:47:55	jsoh	no it wasnt it was that the province did not elect him, because hes a fuckin municipal official

2015-06-29 00:48:57	eroqin	Like being shit at Doto.
2015-06-29 00:49:03	alexdmk	I stated I don't live in the province. Within the province, he was elected, therefore stating that I don't in the province that elected him is a factual statement.
2015-06-29 00:49:05	madic74	stop ksing with powershot

2015-06-29 00:50:10	alexdmk	Quebec created poutine and is responsible for the popularity of it in North America, Canada or USA.
2015-06-29 00:50:15	jsoh	and thinking anyone gave a shit about your opinion 
2015-06-29 00:50:15	uber_pro	hey isnt quebec the place that likes poutine? Kappa

2015-06-29 02:06:26	irteezy	people like to fight bf isnt fighting early game right?

2015-06-29 15:16:34	jsoh	all of the things that made sniper good were made bad
2015-06-29 15:16:37	jsoh	so sniper is now, bad
2015-06-29 15:16:40	danggit_smee	it takes team coordination to use and sniper pickers couldnt do that to save their life
2015-06-29 15:16:48	jsoh	it takes like ten minutes before shrapnel does a damage
2015-06-29 15:16:53	thecatinthehat420	Mom got nerfed

2015-06-29 15:17:34	east718	u run half speed
2015-06-29 15:17:56	jsoh	im pretty sure its mostly the fact that shrapnel takes longer to recharge takes longer to do damage and doesnt give vision anymore 
2015-06-29 15:18:03	jsoh	or the vision changed or some shit
2015-06-29 15:18:18	danggit_smee	it takes a second to start instead of being instant
2015-06-29 15:18:29	danggit_smee	so you couldnt just solo kill everyone

2015-06-30 23:42:40	jsoh	like i said i dont actually do any mind altering substances except like occasionally caffeine . because i have a personal and family history of mental illnesses that can be triggered or intensified by using them

2015-06-30 23:44:56	irteezy	doctors obviously will say drugs are bad...doctor told me i would instantly die if i smoked after day surgery so.....

2015-06-30 23:45:24	east718	depends who your doctor is
2015-06-30 23:45:24	shoe_on_head_please	SPCA should not be able to take away your pups.

2015-06-30 23:46:01	jsoh	generally i dont trust anything a doctor says regarding ~brain chemistry things~ because they dont know how shit works
2015-06-30 23:46:03	jsoh	nobody does
2015-06-30 23:46:28	east718	if we didnt know then rational drug design wouldnt exist

2015-06-30 23:46:39	madic74	I dont like the stigma around doctors, doctors went to 7 years of college and you dont trust them?
2015-06-30 23:46:49	irteezy	so what rofl ^
2015-06-30 23:46:51	east718	we'd still be in the dark ages of trialling random chemicals on rats instead of designing drugs
2015-06-30 23:46:54	shoe_on_head_please	My doctor keeps on wanting to put stuff in my butt.
2015-06-30 23:47:01	irteezy	7 years of college doesn't make you instantly right in everything you say
2015-06-30 23:47:08	newmonolith	not listening to your doctor is how steve jobgs died. listen to your doctors first get well then pick your vices back up 
2015-06-30 23:47:20	madic74	I think because yall live in america and your health care system is fucked and yall complain
2015-06-30 23:47:20	irteezy	i trust 20k people online who all share the same opinion over one doctor who says otherwise
2015-06-30 23:47:38	shoe_on_head_please	But like, I don't like people poking around my butt hole :(
2015-06-30 23:47:42	eroqin	20k people online think the moon landing was fake. Kappa
2015-06-30 23:47:44	irteezy	i don't live in america doctors are like this everywhere dude....

2015-06-30 23:48:07	madic74	@Irteezy thats the most generalised generalisation I have ever heard generalised
2015-06-30 23:48:10	shoe_on_head_please	I have never done butt stuff.
2015-06-30 23:48:15	shoe_on_head_please	And the doc wants to poke around in there.
2015-06-30 23:48:16	madic74	@Irteezy just stop right there
2015-06-30 23:48:26	newmonolith	people online think everything is a cancer or a std 
2015-06-30 23:48:36	irteezy	@Madic74,  i mean if you want to mindlessly take your doctors advice without doing you own research that is your downfall.....gl to you
2015-06-30 23:48:40	noparl	hye2
2015-06-30 23:48:43	newmonolith	just go to the doctor
2015-06-30 23:48:54	madic74	@Irteezy I trust someone who actually has a degree than the internet
2015-06-30 23:48:59	madic74	thanks for the advice though
2015-06-30 23:49:05	irteezy	that's your problem, you mindlessly trust a single person
2015-06-30 23:49:06	ihustlepancakes	this song so hype
2015-06-30 23:49:07	jsoh	look at antidepressants . when know chemically what they do but we dont know why that chemical reaction causes people to get better, or to not get better. or why different ones work better than others for different people when they are almost the same reaction or are causing the same chemical effect
2015-06-30 23:49:11	irteezy	just because he went to college
2015-06-30 23:49:35	shoe_on_head_please	I prefer my doctors unlicensed.
2015-06-30 23:49:37	east718	does it matter why
2015-06-30 23:49:42	madic74	I've never met someone so skeptical in my life tbh
2015-06-30 23:49:44	jsoh	yes
2015-06-30 23:49:53	irteezy	doctors prescribe aropax to people claiming it isn't addictive yet here my mother is addicted to it 20 years latyer...yep doctors are always right dude
2015-06-30 23:50:01	irteezy	keep trusting them 4Head
2015-06-30 23:50:03	eroqin	It kinda matters when we're not even sure if antidepressants are doing anything. EleGiggle
2015-06-30 23:50:05	madic74	do you not leave your house because you might get run over? are you those kind of people
2015-06-30 23:50:08	jsoh	because they often cause people to not get better, or to get worse
2015-06-30 23:50:21	east718	u got a point there
2015-06-30 23:50:26	jsoh	which is pretty shit when dealing with something like depression
2015-06-30 23:50:26	shoe_on_head_please	The SSRI I have seems to be working better than the last 4 I tried.

2015-06-30 23:50:57	shoe_on_head_please	East, the K has helped more than the SSRI or the Xanax haha.
2015-06-30 23:50:58	pandastyle23	:v
2015-06-30 23:51:01	jsoh	because the failure of one treatment fucks up your thoughts towards other treatments
2015-06-30 23:51:12	irteezy	@Madic74, i don't leave my house because my mediciation says so....doctors are always right so i can't leave the house right....?

2015-06-30 23:51:32	madic74	@Irteezy I'm doing a Pharmacy degree, that drug you listed is a Serotin Selective Reuptake Inhibitor, I know how they work, I know that they are not addictiive, but patients may become dependant on it because they feel they are sick once they are diagnosed with depression

2015-06-30 23:52:00	shoe_on_head_please	If you stop an SSRI cold turkey you can have some painful effects as well.
2015-06-30 23:52:03	madic74	@Irteezy it's kind of like a mood stabiliser and chemical balancer
2015-06-30 23:52:12	shoe_on_head_please	They call then "brain zaps"
2015-06-30 23:52:16	irteezy	@Madic74,  so you're saying aropax can be stopped after 20 years of use without effects?
2015-06-30 23:52:29	shoe_on_head_please	Brain zaps!
2015-06-30 23:52:30	madic74	@Irteezy depends on how your mother is feeling
2015-06-30 23:52:32	shoe_on_head_please	Wean yourself off.
2015-06-30 23:52:39	shoe_on_head_please	If you want to quit.
2015-06-30 23:52:43	madic74	I cant psychiatrically anaylse her over the internet
2015-06-30 23:52:46	shoe_on_head_please	Im never gonna give up my pills though haha.
2015-06-30 23:53:03	madic74	just some advice dude, that's all
2015-06-30 23:53:05	irteezy	@Madic74,  she drops like 5mg she goes through hell, so do most people on aropax welcome to aropax doesn't matter what doctors say its a bad drug
2015-06-30 23:53:17	eroqin	What a world we live in where kids can fuck mothers over the internet, but not psychiatrically analyse them.
2015-06-30 23:53:22	east718	aropax has had a really troubled history though
2015-06-30 23:53:22	jsoh	the thrust of my thoughts towards brain drugs is we know chemically what these drugs do but we dont really fully understand how or why these chemical changes in a brain cause their effects. which is hella fucked up for something that is given to millions of people
2015-06-30 23:53:45	irteezy	@east718,  yes but its still being prescribed and doctors are STILL telling people it doesn't have horrible side effects when there is proof it does
2015-06-30 23:53:48	madic74	@Irteezy your cynicism is drivng me bananas, are you saying she goes through hell on the drug? Not on the drug? you weren't specific here
2015-06-30 23:54:07	east718	that is troubling
2015-06-30 23:54:07	eroqin	I don't think doctors would tell you there's no bad side effects.
2015-06-30 23:54:11	irteezy	@Madic74,  dude...she feels perfectly fine on aropax, when she tries to lower the dosage even 5mg she goes through fucking hell
2015-06-30 23:54:22	jsoh	the prophet motive exists in western medicine
2015-06-30 23:54:26	east718	i thought stuff like lexapro was more popular to prescribe atm
2015-06-30 23:54:37	shoe_on_head_please	Thats what I got.
2015-06-30 23:55:12	east718	i think its negligent to prescribe something like that without informing about ssri withdrawals, etc
2015-06-30 23:55:19	madic74	@Irteezy I'm no psychiatrist and neither are you, these drug's have a certain therapeutic effect. That's what they try to do, lower the dosage to see how they go, sometimes they have to be on aporpax for life, for you know, the depressive issues
2015-06-30 23:55:26	east718	>meme shard FailFish
2015-06-30 23:55:38	eroqin	All the drugs I get prescribed always come with pages of stuff.
2015-06-30 23:55:46	madic74	@East718 it really depends on the patient, certain drugs cater for certain patiens and have different underlying effects
2015-06-30 23:55:56	jsoh	if only it was 4v5 for the first 40 minutes you mean
2015-06-30 23:56:17	east718	where did cat lane

2015-06-30 23:56:32	shoe_on_head_please	Somewhere.
2015-06-30 23:56:48	eroqin	She initially roamed.
2015-06-30 23:56:52	eroqin	But then everyone came bot.
2015-06-30 23:56:59	irteezy	@Madic74,  don't think she needs to be on it for life for depression it's more so its hard as fuck to get off it
2015-06-30 23:57:00	madic74	@Irteezy my mum has been on anti-depressants for 4-5 years now and she doesn't really have depression, but it helps her sleep and she seems really happy. Chemically balanced :)
2015-06-30 23:57:03	jsoh	she threw one arrow mid in the first 10 minutes i think
2015-06-30 23:57:20	eroqin	Oh man, that arrow.
2015-06-30 23:57:25	eroqin	That got blocked by melee creep.
2015-06-30 23:57:47	eroqin	Why is she going moonshard?
2015-06-30 23:57:54	madic74	@Irteezy Depression is serious mental illness, it can take as much time as the patient needs. Please contact a doctor as this isn't actual medical advice, For emergencies, call 000

2015-07-03 00:11:23	east718	all these canadians stealing marion berry's steez 4Head
2015-07-03 00:11:25	jsoh	except that like, it only really hurts very old people here
2015-07-03 00:11:37	jsoh	so it hurt the conservatives probably
2015-07-03 00:11:41	thecatinthehat420	Watch kotl become the richest hero on your team.
2015-07-03 00:11:59	jsoh	also the law is being challenged in courts, right now, immediately prior to a national eelction
2015-07-03 00:12:14	jsoh	so they look like they are incompetent and it doesnt even accomplish anything helpful
2015-07-03 00:12:38	ddrhazy	!mmr
2015-07-03 00:12:38	nightbot	end ur lfie
2015-07-03 00:12:43	ddrhazy	interesting
2015-07-03 00:12:50	jsoh	extremely not interesting
2015-07-03 00:13:10	enaur	this sucks
2015-07-03 00:13:57	thecatinthehat420	Actually i think it would hilarious if someone bought drow ranger items on wr like there is no difference.
2015-07-03 00:14:20	danggit_smee	ive seen people buy wraith bands on wr
2015-07-03 00:14:40	east718	i can think of worse wr builds than 3 wraiths mask of death and yasha
2015-07-03 00:15:15	jsoh	the proper build on every single hero in the game is midas octarine core abyssal blade
2015-07-03 00:15:17	danggit_smee	this wk cant handle how good jungle legion is 
2015-07-03 00:15:24	enaur	okay fuck you then hoe
2015-07-03 00:15:28	enaur	whatever
2015-07-03 00:15:38	mouseking	i jungle legion when people dont give me the lane i want
2015-07-03 00:15:52	mrvelociraptor	6 broadswords are most cost efficient damage Kappa
2015-07-03 00:15:52	mouseking	u mad leshrac fanshits EleGiggle
2015-07-03 00:15:57	jsoh	i first pick jungle qop and then get pissy at people when they try to make me lane
2015-07-03 00:16:26	thecatinthehat420	Queen of jungle
2015-07-03 00:16:29	east718	i won a game today with jungle drow eblade rush
2015-07-03 00:16:50	ddrhazy	yeah that sounds fucking awful
2015-07-03 00:16:55	jsoh	have you tried my jungle qop garbage yet east
2015-07-03 00:16:59	jsoh	its very powerful
2015-07-03 00:17:08	mrvelociraptor	i savaged these kids jungle TA once
2015-07-03 00:17:49	danggit_smee	eblade drow probably does a shit ton doesnt it
2015-07-03 00:17:58	ddrhazy	it's fucking awful
2015-07-03 00:18:05	mrvelociraptor	rofl
2015-07-03 00:18:10	east718	its really fucking bad lol
2015-07-03 00:18:14	jsoh	eblade drow used to be the big shit
2015-07-03 00:18:21	jsoh	but then they broke ethereal orbing
2015-07-03 00:18:30	jsoh	because huskar was good for like a week
2015-07-03 00:18:43	east718	charles barkley huskar was definitely a thing for a while
2015-07-03 00:18:55	nightbot	https://twitter.com/lilcocaina
2015-07-03 00:18:57	ddrhazy	huskar does magic damage with his orb, drow does not
2015-07-03 00:18:57	mrvelociraptor	i remember when huskqr was good
2015-07-03 00:18:58	thinkhard3	digging the chill vibes before bed
2015-07-03 00:19:10	danggit_smee	heres something i found out the other day
2015-07-03 00:19:17	jsoh	ddrhazy the thing was eth blade etherealed both caster and target
2015-07-03 00:19:17	danggit_smee	ghost scepter axe
2015-07-03 00:19:21	jsoh	so you use it on the enemy right clicker
2015-07-03 00:19:22	danggit_smee	its fantastic
2015-07-03 00:19:31	jsoh	and then blow up his supports with orb attacks
2015-07-03 00:19:33	jsoh	its awful smee
2015-07-03 00:19:40	jsoh	no getting hit=no spins
2015-07-03 00:19:41	danggit_smee	you blink in, call and waste everyones time
2015-07-03 00:19:55	jsoh	buy force staff instead
2015-07-03 00:19:56	mrvelociraptor	lmfao
2015-07-03 00:19:59	jsoh	aoe lasso
2015-07-03 00:20:00	yesilyurt52	open boobs pls
2015-07-03 00:20:00	ddrhazy	the reason why e blade on huskar worked is because he already has magic resist from his passive, so the e blade magic damage increase didn't matter
2015-07-03 00:20:07	danggit_smee	everyone just gathers around the axe campfire
2015-07-03 00:20:17	thecatinthehat420	Blademail sounds ten times better
2015-07-03 00:20:18	ddrhazy	but on drow it's fucking awful, she'll just be a walking target
2015-07-03 00:20:28	east718	charles barkley huskar - PD thread started 6/5/13, killed by icefrog 10/17/13 BibleThump
2015-07-03 00:20:29	ddrhazy	drow is already an awful hero
2015-07-03 00:20:40	jsoh	it worked on drow, because you have a silence and also because you dont fuckin use it on like lina or something
2015-07-03 00:20:48	jsoh	you use it vs juggernaut or lifestealer or some shit
2015-07-03 00:21:01	thecatinthehat420	I like watching rtz play drow
2015-07-03 00:21:12	danggit_smee	drow isnt bad
2015-07-03 00:21:26	thecatinthehat420	He plays her in the most scrappy way possible.
2015-07-03 00:21:26	danggit_smee	definitely better than at least sniper imo
2015-07-03 00:21:48	ddrhazy	she's countered by any gap closing hero
2015-07-03 00:21:58	danggit_smee	so was sniper
2015-07-03 00:22:01	jsoh	im pretty sure when i was doing that garbage i was playing like, lane uspport drow with medusa clearing ancients
2015-07-03 00:22:12	ddrhazy	sniper is less damaged by gap closing
2015-07-03 00:22:21	east718	i mean thats why you pick the game winning ranked matchmaking heroes first
2015-07-03 00:22:26	east718	and stuff like drow if u can get away with it
2015-07-03 00:22:47	danggit_smee	drow aura is dope though
2015-07-03 00:22:50	ddrhazy	i'm pretty sure if i pick a top tier *** pick like BS or SS, i'm going to destroy any drow pick at any rank be it 1, 2 or 5k
2015-07-03 00:22:58	jsoh	lol if u dont pick the same 5 heroes every patch/every game regardless of if they are garbage
2015-07-03 00:22:59	nightbot	http://instagram.com/lilcocaina
2015-07-03 00:23:00	thecatinthehat420	I want to punch the guy who posted the necro ancient farm video
2015-07-03 00:23:32	jsoh	wait until someone makes dazzle ancients famous
2015-07-03 00:23:50	jsoh	you will get ot see someone feed 7 couriers over and over
2015-07-03 00:24:16	danggit_smee	how does dazzle do ancients?
2015-07-03 00:24:20	east718	with couriers
2015-07-03 00:24:22	danggit_smee	better question
2015-07-03 00:24:24	east718	u healbomb them
2015-07-03 00:24:27	danggit_smee	who the fuck plays dazzle
2015-07-03 00:24:44	jsoh	couriers are targetable for shadow wave, but dont aggro neutrals or block camps
2015-07-03 00:24:47	ddrhazy	all it requires is an investment of 500 gold to get 5 couriers!
2015-07-03 00:24:50	jsoh	so you just stack the ancients like 4 times
2015-07-03 00:24:59	jsoh	i think u mean 7 couriers dude
2015-07-03 00:25:04	ddrhazy	whatever
2015-07-03 00:25:12	jsoh	and then you clear any amount of ancients in 17 seconds
2015-07-03 00:25:21	thecatinthehat420	Lol
2015-07-03 00:25:30	cokaiin	uyedghryeghwfnwegbyfuyrf ??
2015-07-03 00:25:31	pitlord_911	futbol PogChamp 
2015-07-03 00:25:37	danggit_smee	thats crazy
2015-07-03 00:26:04	pandastyle23	helloooo
2015-07-03 00:26:12	pandastyle23	hablas español ya? :v
2015-07-03 00:26:29	jsoh	cat why do you buy demon edge before baby crit
2015-07-03 00:26:35	jsoh	baby crit is way better with max attack speed
2015-07-03 00:26:44	east718	attack speed doesn't matter
2015-07-03 00:26:50	east718	baby crit is better if u have >69 damage
2015-07-03 00:26:54	ddrhazy	5 courier * 120gold = 600 = dazzle not buying any support items for the first 5 minutes of game and not contributing to his safe lane carry's farm
2015-07-03 00:27:00	ruktuku	you cant ask questions like that
2015-07-03 00:27:02	jsoh	its more better with the attack speed
2015-07-03 00:27:10	ddrhazy	because you know, he has to stack ancients to make his game plan work
2015-07-03 00:27:12	ruktuku	you already know the answer
2015-07-03 00:27:17	jsoh	yeah
2015-07-03 00:27:17	east718	no its not josh
2015-07-03 00:27:20	danggit_smee	same thing for anyone doing ancients that eaarly
2015-07-03 00:27:22	east718	they're both linear dps increases
2015-07-03 00:27:22	cokaiin	!mmr
2015-07-03 00:27:23	nightbot	end ur lfie
2015-07-03 00:27:35	jsoh	same for anyone farming neutrals
2015-07-03 00:27:39	jsoh	also you dont buy 5 at the start
2015-07-03 00:27:45	jsoh	because level 1 shadow wave cant even hit 5 couriers
2015-07-03 00:27:51	pandastyle23	first buy maelstorm
2015-07-03 00:28:19	ddrhazy	yeah spam your spells you fucking animal
2015-07-03 00:28:55	nightbot	https://twitter.com/lilcocaina
2015-07-03 00:29:02	pandastyle23	maelstorm, doesn't matter the boots
2015-07-03 00:29:06	pandastyle23	first of all
2015-07-03 00:29:09	pandastyle23	maelstorm
2015-07-03 00:29:25	ddrhazy	crit stick > maelstrom
2015-07-03 00:29:50	ruktuku	but will she ever finish crit stick
2015-07-03 00:29:54	pandastyle23	maelstorm>lose
2015-07-03 00:30:00	danggit_smee	im gonna call that baby crit from now on, thanks josh
2015-07-03 00:30:09	ddrhazy	they are going to get bkbs maelstrom is not useful in mid and late game
2015-07-03 00:30:28	thecatinthehat420	Is slahser going to ti?
2015-07-03 00:30:34	east718	maelstrom costs more than the rest of buriza FailFish
2015-07-03 00:30:57	jsoh	lmao
2015-07-03 00:31:10	ruktuku	yeah run into the meteor path 3+ times
2015-07-03 00:31:12	sl0th5	lol
2015-07-03 00:31:13	jsoh	they assassinated stunned and reapers scythed illusions
2015-07-03 00:31:21	ddrhazy	i dunno why she got the demons edge first
2015-07-03 00:31:28	jsoh	she did it two games in a row
2015-07-03 00:31:39	ruktuku	its the winning formula
2015-07-03 00:31:41	ddrhazy	hmm, better to get the crysals first
2015-07-03 00:31:45	jsoh	much better
2015-07-03 00:31:46	pandastyle23	my friend -yeah, not me,- build maelstorm at max 10 mins 
2015-07-03 00:31:49	east718	because cat bad at math
2015-07-03 00:32:11	jsoh	theres two attack speed items that are acceptable on windrunner
2015-07-03 00:32:12	ruktuku	OpieOP
2015-07-03 00:32:23	jsoh	and they are hand of midas and glimmer cape
2015-07-03 00:32:30	danggit_smee	Butterfly and diffusal
2015-07-03 00:32:35	jsoh	garbage
2015-07-03 00:32:36	kurwablyatfitte	http://www.tremorgames.com/?ref=1404675
2015-07-03 00:32:37	ddrhazy	generally attack speed on wind is not great on heroes like that as they get max attack speed with their skills
2015-07-03 00:32:39	danggit_smee	lol
2015-07-03 00:32:51	pandastyle23	http://www.dotabuff.com/items/maelstrom
2015-07-03 00:32:56	ddrhazy	that's like getting mask on ursa
2015-07-03 00:32:57	ruktuku	cat will never buy another midas

2015-07-03 00:34:04	thecatinthehat420	There whole team was there
2015-07-03 00:34:17	danggit_smee	but if you never buy any attack speed on wind or ursa, you never have it outside of using those spells
2015-07-03 00:34:28	ddrhazy	so?
2015-07-03 00:34:40	danggit_smee	which is a problem for farming
2015-07-03 00:34:43	danggit_smee	kinda
2015-07-03 00:34:44	ddrhazy	not really
2015-07-03 00:34:48	danggit_smee	at least for wind
2015-07-03 00:35:02	rodserling1	pl muito ruim caralho

2015-07-03 00:35:12	ddrhazy	looks like she's farming just fine with power shot
2015-07-03 00:35:15	danggit_smee	see josh has got it
2015-07-03 00:35:35	ddrhazy	wr is a spell casting hero, you're supposed to use your spells to do stuff
2015-07-03 00:35:48	ddrhazy	she's not a typical physical dps
2015-07-03 00:36:02	thecatinthehat420	How bad would diffusal blade be here?
2015-07-03 00:36:16	ddrhazy	not useful, PL should be enough to deal with WK

2015-07-03 22:58:56	dunkcow	refresher over aghs
2015-07-03 22:59:07	dunkcow	aghs when they have blink is really bad
2015-07-03 22:59:12	usernamefortwitcherino	cat toggle q on. it procs e
2015-07-03 22:59:12	jsoh	no its not
2015-07-03 22:59:29	jsoh	aghs is fuckin naga song + damage
2015-07-03 22:59:32	jsoh	who cares if axe blinks away
2015-07-03 22:59:33	east718	i come to cats chat for the STRATEGIC KNOWLEDGE BOMBS PogChamp
2015-07-03 22:59:39	jsoh	you win the fight 4v5 then
2015-07-03 22:59:39	nightbot	https://twitter.com/lilcocaina
2015-07-03 22:59:42	jsoh	or i guess 4v4 in this game
2015-07-03 22:59:46	galloblanco559	who wouldnt feed for some cat abuse Kappa
2015-07-03 22:59:51	dunkcow	it gives them time to react to whats going on
2015-07-03 23:00:04	jsoh	team has lina on it
2015-07-03 23:00:32	jsoh	also it applies the mana burn every time, and gives you 11 damage or whatever  for everyone you hit
2015-07-03 23:01:02	jsoh	that mana burn is huge vs like axe potm clock
2015-07-03 23:01:50	vegetablemind	dota2 owns
2015-07-03 23:02:16	dunkcow	@Jsoh okay, here we go. the imprision duration is 4 seconds which allows the blink dagger to come off cooldown and with and axe call can be pretty devastating
2015-07-03 23:02:16	twinkly_twinkle	Hello
2015-07-03 23:02:31	jsoh	that is assuming its only on damage cooldown
2015-07-03 23:02:50	jsoh	which is often not going to be the case, in a team fight.
2015-07-03 23:03:04	ferravox	I like your taste in music 👍🏻. Do you have any of A$AP's new album that you can play?
2015-07-03 23:03:08	camelkyhn	very efficient tits
2015-07-03 23:03:11	dunkcow	if you use it as an initiation it will be
2015-07-03 23:03:22	jsoh	it also banishes everyone else you hit allowing your team to freely reposition and/or focus the shit out of a bkb hero
2015-07-03 23:03:24	jsoh	like naga song
2015-07-03 23:04:08	ferravox	How about Juicy J?
2015-07-03 23:04:41	dunkcow	yeh dude i agree, it can be risky since you cant target them but i guess this is 2k and anything can happen
2015-07-03 23:04:47	jsoh	vs certain heroes aghs is awful i dont tihnk vs just blink dagger in general tho
2015-07-03 23:05:05	jsoh	like unless you are going to outright kill am or qop or morphling or something you just let them escape most likely
2015-07-03 23:05:13	omidness	new camera angel 
2015-07-03 23:05:13	ferravox	Play "Show Out" by Juicy J or "Excuse Me" by A$AP Rocky?
2015-07-03 23:05:26	galloblanco559	did you fart?
2015-07-03 23:05:28	jsoh	unless you have aghs+refresher then every hero in the game basically gets fucked
2015-07-03 23:05:30	dunkcow	also in regards to "naga song" watch the LCD vs IG play from World Cyber Arena

2015-07-06 02:07:45	jsoh	What I'm going to tell you now is very important if you plan on doing extreme sessions and taking large gauge. Do not bandage your ass. Do not tighten your buttocks. Try not to get an erecection -- you want the blood to be in your ass lips, not in your cock. It's not easy, but it's important that you think of nothing and empty your mind. It's absolutely necessary that you concentrate on your breathing. Don't think of the pain; know that it will pass. The real secret though is to breath -- and remember, without the pain, it's IMPOSSIBLE TO TAKE THE BIG ONES!

2015-07-06 02:35:19	east718	I sexually identify as cat6669. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of flaming apes in Dota 2 and insulting people based on their skill at meaningless video games. People say to me that a person being cat is impossible and I'm fucking retarded but I don't care, I'm beautiful. From now on I want you guys to call me cat and respect my right to rage and flame mongs all around the world for not getting laid. If you can't accept me you're a catphobe and need to check your privilege.

2015-07-08 01:36:12	getindasnowball	Thirst was retardedly strong since the rework, not just this patch
2015-07-08 01:36:28	eroqin	His original skill was a passive.
2015-07-08 01:36:34	eroqin	Adding mana to it would be too different.
2015-07-08 01:36:38	getindasnowball	It's just pubs had no idea how to play him and he didn't really fit vs troll
2015-07-08 01:36:45	newmonolith	cat is feed tonight
2015-07-08 01:36:46	eroqin	And I mean the healing passive.
2015-07-08 01:36:48	ddrhazy	bloodrage was a silence that was castable on a single target before
2015-07-08 01:36:52	snutz_x	Bloodrage our self
2015-07-08 01:37:02	bayfvckinlife	report  and mute pls
2015-07-08 01:37:05	eroqin	Having to use mana to heal would be terrible.
2015-07-08 01:37:07	ddrhazy	now it's an AOE that takes time to "cast"
2015-07-08 01:37:16	pyrofrantic	its hard to imagine your techeis being worse thatn this
2015-07-08 01:37:17	snutz_x	Bloodrage doesnot silence

2015-07-08 01:38:01	ddrhazy	and now i'm going to tell you why that's stupid
2015-07-08 01:38:07	ddrhazy	basher is a pseudo random proc
2015-07-08 01:38:08	jsoh	lmao
2015-07-08 01:38:16	ddrhazy	which goes on CD

2015-07-08 01:38:57	getindasnowball	The CD doesn't matter, with the attack speed it procs literally all the time and you're nearly constantly stunned, mkb is better yes, but basher is viable
2015-07-08 01:39:10	ddrhazy	it's awful
2015-07-08 01:39:15	jsoh	its good
2015-07-08 01:39:21	ddrhazy	in what? your 3k games?

2015-07-08 01:39:38	getindasnowball	IF you need the stun more than damage you go basher > maelstrom, but that shouldn't happen.
2015-07-08 01:39:39	ddrhazy	i dunno man, i dislike when people put clowny builds out there

2015-07-08 01:41:02	jsoh	so you will on average hit a bash within 10 hits, which is less than the duration of shackle

2015-07-08 01:47:30	jsoh	the proper thing to do when you get ruptured is to have your entire team use their blink daggers and then their aoe stun
2015-07-08 01:47:46	getindasnowball	Yes, but complete ability denial is not mobility denial, boy
2015-07-08 01:47:46	ddrhazy	no, you just walk to safety
2015-07-08 01:47:49	ddrhazy	and have your team mates guard you
2015-07-08 01:47:52	sean52183	Batrider is the worst hero

2015-07-08 01:50:53	ddrhazy	http://www.georgerrmartin.com/excerpt-from-the-winds-of-winter/
2015-07-08 01:50:56	pinky_the_badass	she has to fuck his dogs
2015-07-08 01:51:02	jsoh	she gets beaten and tortured and forced to sex up some dogs + theon
2015-07-08 01:51:03	pinky_the_badass	and also theon has to "warm her up" for him
2015-07-08 01:51:10	ddrhazy	she doesn't get raped, she gets whisked away by theon and captured by stannis
2015-07-08 01:51:10	shinzu	rofl

2015-07-08 01:51:26	jsoh	theon rescues her like months after the wedding
2015-07-08 01:51:27	jsoh	weeks at least
2015-07-08 01:51:33	pinky_the_badass	when theon comes to get her shes so broken he has to forcibly take her
2015-07-08 01:51:42	pinky_the_badass	cause she thinks it's a cruel trick from ramsay
2015-07-08 01:51:46	shinzu	who actually read the books(most of em anyways)
2015-07-08 01:51:53	ddrhazy	i read it but it's been a while
2015-07-08 01:51:59	pinky_the_badass	the show is such a dissapointment
2015-07-08 01:52:02	pinky_the_badass	this past season
2015-07-08 01:52:17	pinky_the_badass	books have always been better but in the first 3 seassons the show was able to holdl upp quite well
2015-07-08 01:52:28	jsoh	the books are cool. if you read the books good u find out that even tho tyrion shot tywin tywin was already poisoned and was going to die anyway
2015-07-08 01:52:33	getindasnowball	Well they didn't advance the plot of the show at all because they're at the books end nearly.
2015-07-08 01:52:37	pinky_the_badass	thats a theory
2015-07-08 01:52:40	pinky_the_badass	not confirmed
2015-07-08 01:52:43	jsoh	and also that joffery sent the assassin after bran b/c hes a retard
2015-07-08 01:52:54	pinky_the_badass	those are all theories
2015-07-08 01:52:56	pvtscrum	he was trying to impress his fake dad
2015-07-08 01:52:58	pinky_the_badass	though i agree with the joffrey one
2015-07-08 01:53:05	jsoh	the joffery one is pretty explicit
2015-07-08 01:53:11	jsoh	the poison one is too
2015-07-08 01:53:14	pinky_the_badass	the tywin one i dont think is true
2015-07-08 01:53:24	eroqin	Ah!
2015-07-08 01:53:25	jsoh	also wyman manderly kills and eats some freys

2015-07-08 01:53:31	shinzu	i don't mind difference between tv and books tho 
2015-07-08 01:53:36	pinky_the_badass	yeah that ones pretty much confirmed
2015-07-08 01:53:37	shinzu	look at all the horrible adaptions 
2015-07-08 01:53:40	pvtscrum	dude wyman manderly is boss
2015-07-08 01:53:49	pinky_the_badass	i dont mind difference between tv and show i just mind that the show is trash these days
2015-07-08 01:53:55	jsoh	i stopped watching the tv show b.c of the terrible adaptation of tyrions escape/his last meeting with jaime
2015-07-08 01:54:02	getindasnowball	How has alch no farm
2015-07-08 01:54:08	bobraie	Hello Cat

2015-07-08 01:54:25	pinky_the_badass	i initially hated it
2015-07-08 01:54:30	pinky_the_badass	but i dont actually mind that part of the show
2015-07-08 01:54:30	eroqin	Alch is a support that transitions to carry. Him being your carry is a bad idea.
2015-07-08 01:54:31	pinky_the_badass	too much
2015-07-08 01:54:35	pvtscrum	Stannis killed his daughter and got nothing out of it really
2015-07-08 01:54:45	pinky_the_badass	the show butchered stannis
2015-07-08 01:54:48	jsoh	thats because gods not real
2015-07-08 01:54:54	pinky_the_badass	in the books stannis is the fucking mannis
2015-07-08 01:54:56	pvtscrum	lord of light is real
2015-07-08 01:55:19	pinky_the_badass	stannis is easily the best contender for iron throne
2015-07-08 01:55:23	jsoh	the only true god a tree
2015-07-08 01:55:30	getindasnowball	Stannis isn't really the Azhor Ashai or however you spell it.
2015-07-08 01:55:39	pinky_the_badass	hes not azor ahai but hes the fuckin mannis
2015-07-08 01:55:48	pvtscrum	the letter jon gets from ramsey says he has stannis's head
2015-07-08 01:55:55	pvtscrum	stannis might be dead yo
2015-07-08 01:55:55	jsoh	its not from ramsay

2015-07-08 01:56:08	pvtscrum	Go fly a kite
2015-07-08 01:56:10	pinky_the_badass	jon is theorized to be azor ahai but it seems too obvious to me
2015-07-08 01:56:26	getindasnowball	Cat, you should have built maelstrom+bkb instead of going for sb/silver edge
2015-07-08 01:56:26	pheekdani	nice fucking hero
2015-07-08 01:56:27	pvtscrum	Jon Targaryen Kappa
2015-07-08 01:56:31	pinky_the_badass	also reading some fan theoriies on reddit doesnt make you have good reading comprehension lmao
2015-07-08 01:56:40	pinky_the_badass	i've read em all too
2015-07-08 01:56:40	jsoh	i dont read reddit
2015-07-08 01:56:49	pvtscrum	what's reddit?
2015-07-08 01:56:59	pinky_the_badass	in any case the letter isn't true
2015-07-08 01:57:07	jsoh	the only time i see reddit is when someone shows me a reddit and its exclusively people being disgusting
2015-07-08 01:57:10	jsoh	never anything about fiction
2015-07-08 01:57:11	pinky_the_badass	though im still not 100% that iit wasnt written by ramsay
2015-07-08 01:57:19	eroqin	I gotta look at this game in-game. How is this game not over yet?
2015-07-08 01:57:30	pheekdani	LMFAO
2015-07-08 01:57:36	pinky_the_badass	if it's not ramsay it's probably roose
2015-07-08 01:57:36	jsoh	it wasnt written by ramsay unless grrm is a terrible garbage author
2015-07-08 01:57:49	getindasnowball	Also bloodrage your lina for more damage on laguna
2015-07-08 01:57:51	pvtscrum	Who then?
2015-07-08 01:58:04	pinky_the_badass	i guess you could say it was written by manderly
2015-07-08 01:58:07	pinky_the_badass	or some other northern lord
2015-07-08 01:58:11	pinky_the_badass	conspiring againnst the boltons
2015-07-08 01:58:11	pvtscrum	Treads shift for mana to ult
2015-07-08 01:58:25	pinky_the_badass	honestly i think it could still be written by ramsay
2015-07-08 01:58:32	jsoh	but, its fair to say that grrm is a terrible garbage author
2015-07-08 01:58:43	ruktuku	he is
2015-07-08 01:58:54	jsoh	remember how tyrion spends his first like 4 chapters being a circus performer and then its never mentioned again
2015-07-08 01:58:55	pvtscrum	it was all i could do 
2015-07-08 01:59:14	jsoh	a bunch of dumb nerd shit
2015-07-08 01:59:25	pinky_the_badass	lmao i dont even know what jsoh is talkinmg about
2015-07-08 01:59:26	pvtscrum	it's mentioned in book 5 about learning about mummery and shit
2015-07-08 01:59:31	getindasnowball	All the fantasy authors are great at writing a setting, but advancing the plot: not so much.
2015-07-08 01:59:45	pvtscrum	you dont remember how they introduce tyrion?
2015-07-08 01:59:48	pinky_the_badass	an GRRM is one of best modern authors
2015-07-08 01:59:54	jsoh	hes awful
2015-07-08 02:00:01	nightbot	https://twitter.com/lilcocaina
2015-07-08 02:00:01	jsoh	or rather, hes insanely inconsistent within his own universe
2015-07-08 02:00:02	pvtscrum	he is repetetive
2015-07-08 02:00:08	jsoh	forgetting things about characters and plot points
2015-07-08 02:00:23	pinky_the_badass	ASOIAF has very little plotholes
2015-07-08 02:00:27	pinky_the_badass	idk what you're talking about
2015-07-08 02:00:35	jsoh	you have poor reading comprehension
2015-07-08 02:00:48	pvtscrum	his timeline is very flexible because he will just ignore a character for a book or two 
2015-07-08 02:00:48	pinky_the_badass	lol
2015-07-08 02:00:49	jsoh	and/or recall
2015-07-08 02:00:57	getindasnowball	The way GRRM introduced Others was retarded
2015-07-08 02:01:01	jsoh	his timeline is very flexible because he doesnt think about the timeline at all
2015-07-08 02:01:05	ruktuku	its perfect for the modern audience with ADHD
2015-07-08 02:01:11	eroqin	Huh, Radiant is only 5k ahead in gold.
2015-07-08 02:01:18	shinzu	lol agreed with @Ruktuku

2015-07-08 02:01:22	thatkidkris	Yo. Its humid as fuck outside. I feel like ive been sweating all damn day. 
2015-07-08 02:01:22	pinky_the_badass	is pretty trash
2015-07-08 02:01:37	headforthecoast	lmao
2015-07-08 02:01:43	getindasnowball	Cat, they were dewardging there, why did you run through there in invis?
2015-07-08 02:01:43	pinky_the_badass	but GRRM goes to a lot of lengths to make every plot point believable
2015-07-08 02:01:44	jsoh	congrats cat u baited a bunch of illusions
2015-07-08 02:01:47	headforthecoast	gr8 b8 m8 i r8 8/8

2015-07-08 02:02:34	pvtscrum	No sense in defending a trash author
2015-07-08 02:02:38	jsoh	characters change without any reason for them to have changed. mostly just from like first book to 4th or whatever. he had some plots planned and then threw them out and semi started over but didnt rewrite earlier chapters
2015-07-08 02:02:51	pinky_the_badass	ok give me an example

2015-07-08 02:03:35	jsoh	tyrion the acrobat in early book one becomes clumsy and slow and awkward after that]

2015-07-08 02:04:14	pinky_the_badass	people can change
2015-07-08 02:04:23	pvtscrum	when would he have used his ability to do carwheels in books 2-3?
2015-07-08 02:04:24	pvtscrum	3
2015-07-08 02:04:25	jsoh	when he meets jon hes tumbling and rolling around and showing off
2015-07-08 02:04:26	pinky_the_badass	and hes not that acrobatic in the freakshow
2015-07-08 02:04:48	jsoh	its that hes described as being clumsy and shit which doesnt follow well
2015-07-08 02:05:22	pheekdani	lol
2015-07-08 02:05:38	pinky_the_badass	i actually dont remember tyrion doing cartwheels or any of that shit
2015-07-08 02:05:39	jsoh	also the thing with robbs wife where her physical properties are described so differently by different characters internal monologue that he had to clarify on his livejournal that it wasnt a imposter
2015-07-08 02:05:40	pinky_the_badass	when he meets jon

2015-07-08 02:06:17	pinky_the_badass	and the westerling thing was a mistake but it was such a minor detail

2015-07-08 02:15:50	pvtscrum	book 5 goes farther than book 4
2015-07-08 02:15:53	pinky_the_badass	book 5 happens alongside book 4
2015-07-08 02:15:56	eroqin	He still doesn't have diffusal .
2015-07-08 02:15:56	pinky_the_badass	it doesnt go that much further
2015-07-08 02:16:01	eroqin	Diffusal 2.
2015-07-08 02:16:03	pinky_the_badass	probably on a ship
2015-07-08 02:16:06	pinky_the_badass	going to mereen
2015-07-08 02:16:08	pinky_the_badass	that takes time

2015-07-08 02:16:23	pvtscrum	literally 
2015-07-08 02:16:25	jsoh	victarions not there yet

2015-07-08 02:16:31	pvtscrum	he is practically there
2015-07-08 02:16:41	pinky_the_badass	and marwyn could be practically there too
2015-07-08 02:16:42	jsoh	u did it cat

2015-07-08 02:16:45	pinky_the_badass	we dont know cause we dont have his POV
2015-07-08 02:17:03	getindasnowball	Cat pls, how do you plan on dealing with PL? Radiance is not gonna cut it
2015-07-08 02:17:23	jsoh	the aclhemist with the battlefury is the plan i think
2015-07-08 02:17:31	eroqin	PL isn't really that scary.
2015-07-08 02:17:31	tp313	fantasy books r not real literature
2015-07-08 02:17:31	cl2ash	@Cat6669 Hey cat what's up
2015-07-08 02:17:36	eroqin	His items aren't that great.
2015-07-08 02:18:13	pvtscrum	They are doing it? DansGame
2015-07-08 02:18:40	eroqin	So Radiant sees their PL get blown up and they go in as 2? Okay.

2015-07-08 02:19:54	eroqin	Dire is 4 out of the top 5 for networth.
2015-07-08 02:20:00	tp313	it's called megabasher nerd
2015-07-08 02:20:01	nightbot	https://twitter.com/lilcocaina
2015-07-08 02:20:04	thatkidkris	this game is still going
2015-07-08 02:20:24	ahundredboners	someone on your team should have a vlads that 15% is like a bazillion damage for u
2015-07-08 02:20:30	eroqin	PL is the only Radiant that farmed. Everyone else jerked off.
2015-07-08 02:20:38	thecatinthehat420	It's a techies game.
2015-07-08 02:20:44	getindasnowball	Skadi would be better here with shrek and echo, radiance gives miss chance already
2015-07-08 02:20:51	thecatinthehat420	Wont be over for another hour
2015-07-08 02:20:52	ahundredboners	implying high skil lplayers dont do both at the same time
2015-07-08 02:20:57	jsoh	no one has a radiance udde
2015-07-08 02:21:02	pvtscrum	these 3.7k throws are so real
2015-07-08 02:21:14	pinky_the_badass	honestly shivas would be pretty good
2015-07-08 02:21:19	pinky_the_badass	or hex
2015-07-08 02:21:41	pinky_the_badass	the s blade is pretty much useless
2015-07-08 02:21:46	lilfletch72	Cat you need to get the cat ears headphones back!
2015-07-08 02:21:51	jsoh	turns off passives
2015-07-08 02:22:08	getindasnowball	What passives pl? you gotta hit the right one
2015-07-08 02:22:11	pinky_the_badass	so
2015-07-08 02:22:17	jsoh	40% damage reduction too
2015-07-08 02:22:17	getindasnowball	That didn't happen yet
2015-07-08 02:22:19	pinky_the_badass	ES aftershock?
2015-07-08 02:22:30	pinky_the_badass	even if u hit the right pl he jsut dopplegangers and purges it
2015-07-08 02:22:30	jsoh	it makes nightmare batman slower
2015-07-08 02:22:42	pinky_the_badass	night stalker has a bkb
2015-07-08 02:22:45	jsoh	also, 40% damage reduction
2015-07-08 02:22:48	getindasnowball	aftershock is nice, but not enough to actually make edge worth the slot+money
2015-07-08 02:22:53	eroqin	BKB can purge ti.
2015-07-08 02:23:04	eroqin	But chances are NS will use BKB fast.
2015-07-08 02:23:13	eroqin	Because lion lina.
2015-07-08 02:23:19	jsoh	it also makes u run fast
2015-07-08 02:23:29	jsoh	wich is the strongest thing in the entire game
2015-07-08 02:23:31	pinky_the_badass	because bloodseeker's main problem is movement speed
2015-07-08 02:23:33	pinky_the_badass	LMAO
2015-07-08 02:23:48	jsoh	look at her ms right now

2015-07-08 02:24:03	getindasnowball	for some reason
2015-07-08 02:24:44	pinky_the_badass	i dont think manta is good here
2015-07-08 02:24:45	getindasnowball	Flutter replaces it, but still
2015-07-08 02:24:54	pinky_the_badass	she has bkb already
2015-07-08 02:24:55	jsoh	she will never cast flutter
2015-07-08 02:24:56	jsoh	this entire game
2015-07-08 02:25:00	eroqin	Instead of Shadowblade, a SnY would've done a little more.
2015-07-08 02:25:02	getindasnowball	Sny would be better if she went for it before silver edge
2015-07-08 02:25:42	pinky_the_badass	she should just get daedelus
2015-07-08 02:25:51	pinky_the_badass	or mkb iif pl has evasion

2015-09-24 02:00:51	memeusdankius	And the retards in 3k don't know what forcestaff does
2015-09-24 02:01:15	memeusdankius	HAHA LOOK TECHIES MINES LET'S DEMINE IT
2015-09-24 02:01:26	memeusdankius	> instant forcestaff into mines
2015-09-24 02:02:03	numeta	I just axe pick into techies shitters.
2015-09-24 02:02:12	numeta	There is one major inconsistency between dota 1 and 2
2015-09-24 02:02:21	numeta	it's that Blademail is supposed to reflect remote and land mine damage, but it does not in dota 2
2015-09-24 02:02:24	numeta	a huge problem with the game
2015-09-24 02:02:28	memeusdankius	Dude
2015-09-24 02:02:32	remusremus	no thats on purpose
2015-09-24 02:02:35	memeusdankius	Dazzle shallow grave and blademail
2015-09-24 02:02:36	numeta	I doubt it
2015-09-24 02:02:36	remusremus	that was just a limitation in dota 1
2015-09-24 02:02:41	memeusdankius	I cried so hard in the first few days
2015-09-24 02:02:53	remusremus	non hero units never reflect blade mail damage onto the hero in dota 2
2015-09-24 02:02:55	alksoe310	Didn't derank
2015-09-24 02:02:55	numeta	It's a huge part of the hero not being strong.
2015-09-24 02:02:57	alksoe310	Still gucci
2015-09-24 02:03:00	remusremus	like it doesnt work again death ward and warlock golem
2015-09-24 02:03:07	remusremus	why would it work on land mines
2015-09-24 02:03:14	numeta	...
2015-09-24 02:03:20	remusremus	doesnt make sense
2015-09-24 02:03:32	numeta	You're asking for logic in a fantasy game
2015-09-24 02:03:39	remusremus	lol what
2015-09-24 02:03:39	numeta	I'm telling you the facts of balance that dota and techies were built on
2015-09-24 02:03:49	remusremus	basic game rules dude
2015-09-24 02:03:51	numeta	and it's missing in dota 2 is what im saying
2015-09-24 02:04:06	memeusdankius	So axe ult should be 99999 damage again?
2015-09-24 02:04:12	numeta	Surely if blademail was working correctly techies woudln't be such a broken hero at the moment
2015-09-24 02:04:13	memeusdankius	And ez blademail
2015-09-24 02:04:19	remusremus	ok
2015-09-24 02:04:34	memeusdankius	c9 just shitted on leviathan techies in grand finals
2015-09-24 02:05:03	nightbot	https://twitter.com/lilcocaina

2015-09-27 20:55:27	crazyi1	ur FPS goes from 10-120
2015-09-27 20:55:28	kurbadubdub	what is this noise you're talking about
2015-09-27 20:55:42	only_plays_medic	Source 1 games. EleGiggle
2015-09-27 20:55:53	crazyi1	yes
2015-09-27 20:56:34	crazyi1	I gave up on when CS went to 64 tick pubs, but if its like source your FPS is tied to your output
2015-09-27 20:56:38	crazyi1	and if your FPS is dropping to 10
2015-09-27 20:56:44	crazyi1	its fucking with your hit registry
2015-09-27 20:57:16	crazyi1	thats how it was in source, cant say for sure in CS:GO
2015-09-27 20:57:21	justicejacoby	How did those miss?
2015-09-27 20:57:37	crazyi1	im tellin you why :)
2015-09-27 20:57:40	crazyi1	read the words
2015-09-27 20:58:07	crazyi1	also 64 tick servers suck and thats all CS:GO pubs
2015-09-27 20:58:14	crazyi1	source pubs went to 100 tick
2015-09-27 20:58:26	crazyi1	competitive CS:GO servers are 130 tick
2015-09-27 20:59:02	crazyi1	What was the question? I am on teamspeak
2015-09-27 20:59:16	crazyi1	didnt hear
2015-09-27 20:59:30	only_plays_medic	1 tick is bad for your pets, I can't imagine what 130 would do to a server. D:
2015-09-27 20:59:42	tedslugthesmugbug	He hehe he heeh
2015-09-27 21:00:03	crazyi1	I would assume its cheaper because it is sending less information per time amount
2015-09-27 21:00:30	crazyi1	but I cannot say for certain
2015-09-27 21:01:35	andretti17montana	Ayee
2015-09-27 21:01:59	alksoe310	Least you aren't falling asleep anymore
2015-09-27 21:02:01	andretti17montana	Surgery had me like Kreygasm
2015-09-27 21:02:13	crazyi1	Your CMD/Up rates are holding steady so maybe they seperated FPS and up rates in Source 2
2015-09-27 21:02:20	crazyi1	or they fucked with the netgraph
2015-09-27 21:02:59	crazyi1	So you are on a 64 tick server
2015-09-27 21:03:03	crazyi1	Look at the right of net graph
2015-09-27 21:03:10	crazyi1	your up/cmd = 64
2015-09-27 21:03:16	crazyi1	that is your in and out information
2015-09-27 21:03:54	andretti17montana	It feels so wierd
2015-09-27 21:04:05	crazyi1	lol
2015-09-27 21:04:16	nightbot	https://twitter.com/lilcocaina
2015-09-27 21:04:21	crazyi1	Well your have data coming in, and data going out
2015-09-27 21:04:25	crazyi1	tick = how fast it can send it
2015-09-27 21:04:49	crazyi1	higher the tick, the more information per second it can send/recieve
2015-09-27 21:05:42	crazyi1	aka how precise your shots are
2015-09-27 21:05:45	monkberry_moon_delight	sup cat momma
2015-09-27 21:05:53	crazyi1	you cant sadly in CS:GO
2015-09-27 21:05:55	crazyi1	thats why I dont play it
2015-09-27 21:06:16	crazyi1	source most servers were 100 tick, a rare few were 64
2015-09-27 21:06:19	ness47	helo
2015-09-27 21:06:25	ness47	the quality is funky
2015-09-27 21:07:17	crazyi1	I played competitive in source, there is a massive difference. I have no clue why they went backwards, perhaps for the average it doesnt matter
2015-09-27 21:07:35	crazyi1	but if you have a strong twitch shot, it will greatly effect it
2015-09-27 21:07:44	210reaper	Dude, swag. I went to the kitchen to make myself a grilled cheese and my roommate made me cupcakes
2015-09-27 21:07:46	210reaper	score
2015-09-27 21:08:08	crazyi1	like you said earlier its probably cheaper
2015-09-27 21:08:10	crazyi1	to host a server
2015-09-27 21:08:14	crazyi1	because less data is being sent
2015-09-27 21:08:16	nightbot	http://instagram.com/lilcocaina
2015-09-27 21:08:48	crazyi1	shoot like you had a .25s delay from where you think it will hit
2015-09-27 21:09:01	crazyi1	even though that is impractical
2015-09-27 21:10:37	crazyi1	but there are console commands that will help with tick rate
2015-09-27 21:11:03	justicejacoby	14 yrs old and 80 pounds XD
2015-09-27 21:11:12	crazyi1	cl_cmdrate 101, cl_updaterate 101, rate 30000 is what they use to be
2015-09-27 21:11:27	mercury12314	is that too young for EE? i can't remember Kappa

2015-09-27 22:41:40	jsoh	to lose a game as terror blade required for 2/5 of my team to tilt hard enough that one chain fed and the other afk farmed
2015-09-27 22:41:41	epic_canister	2012-2013 morph nerf was the worst
2015-09-27 22:42:15	jsoh	my fav thing was i cast relfection at probably max range and killed spectre because her own illusion desolate hit her, and also killed someone else with her radiance burn
2015-09-27 22:42:33	east718	manta has a low cd on melee heroes just so melee carries could be viable vs morph/medusa
2015-09-27 22:42:58	jsoh	terror blade got a huge buff to aegis and buyback too
2015-09-27 22:43:01	epic_canister	Frane loss for anyone else?
