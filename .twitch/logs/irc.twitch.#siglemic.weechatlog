2015-07-03 21:40:09	julians96	i know that if you land in between the first and second stair it's free, but that's pretty hard to do consistently
2015-07-03 21:40:12	mashmelolive	and all the japanese runner
2015-07-03 21:40:17	s_freak	best is to just practice it a lot, you'll get it down @Bpopo 
2015-07-03 21:40:20	mashmelolive	*runners like xiah etc
2015-07-03 21:40:31	rlux	does biinny even know it lol
2015-07-03 21:40:37	widditsama	japanese runners were bred for bljs
2015-07-03 21:40:38	mashmelolive	thats why they are so consistent at it, they wouldnt be consistent at all if there wasnt a timing for it

2015-07-03 21:42:09	julians96	so what is this timing?
2015-07-03 21:42:44	rlux	does mashmelo know it?
2015-07-03 21:42:52	mashmelolive	I dont know it exactly, but Its something like: mash twice really fast as you hit the stairs, wait a split of a sec and then mash a
2015-07-03 21:42:57	mashmelolive	but Im not a 16 star runner
2015-07-03 21:43:01	mashmelolive	you should ask Fuzzy or Puncay
2015-07-03 21:43:22	julians96	isn't that just timed mashing?
2015-07-03 21:43:25	julians96	like i said before
2015-07-03 21:43:34	mashmelolive	theres a rythim to it in the beginning
2015-07-03 21:43:35	piopio34	siggyyy il s'appelle siggyyy
2015-07-03 21:43:35	julians96	where you only mash when you hit the stairs?
2015-07-03 21:43:36	mashmelolive	you dont just mash
2015-07-03 21:43:46	julians96	there's a rythym for the second blj
2015-07-03 21:43:56	julians96	but the first i just mash usually, noob or not
2015-07-03 21:44:03	mashmelolive	dude trust me there is a timing for it im not making up ask some of the top 16 runners
2015-07-03 21:44:13	julians96	i guess there's a rythym to it, i'm not doubting it
2015-07-03 21:44:22	mashmelolive	yeah
2015-07-03 21:44:31	brookxiii	Did you hear about the famous microbiologist who traveled in thirty different countries and learned to speak six languages?  He was a man of many cultures. 
2015-07-03 21:44:31	mashmelolive	also its ok to mash its just less consistent
2015-07-03 21:44:37	mashmelolive	I mash too cause Idc about 16
2015-07-03 21:44:41	julians96	if only there was a blj setup
2015-07-03 21:44:45	mashmelolive	but if you actually care you should learn the timing

2015-07-03 22:15:21	mcmitcho	no
2015-07-03 22:15:22	lakilester5626	it is when that split was faster than in their PB
2015-07-03 22:15:23	happyphotocopy	if it was ahead
2015-07-03 22:15:24	pepperbelli	*** 
2015-07-03 22:15:24	mcmitcho	gold is best of all time

2015-07-03 22:15:42	chickenlivernuts	gold is best on that set on splits, not necessarily of all time

2015-07-03 22:16:19	shadovv	PogChamp 
2015-07-03 22:16:26	happyphotocopy	is your split compared to what your time was at that split on your pb single segment run?
2015-07-03 22:16:28	lakilester5626	red means it was worse than the split in your pb
2015-07-03 22:16:34	chickenlivernuts	yes happy
2015-07-03 22:16:36	happyphotocopy	not your pb of that split
2015-07-03 22:16:36	mcmitcho	no
2015-07-03 22:16:40	mcmitcho	just your pb overall
2015-07-03 22:17:01	happyphotocopy	mcmitcho, for simplicity lets assume you only ever ran the whole game as a single segment
2015-07-03 22:17:05	happyphotocopy	then the answer is yes, right?
2015-07-03 22:17:08	ski_pants	gold is best time for just that particular segment, out of every run recorded
2015-07-03 22:17:14	mcmitcho	every PB would be a gold
2015-07-03 22:17:20	lakilester5626	Will he attempt the Shiguri cycle? poop
2015-07-03 22:17:24	happyphotocopy	what
2015-07-03 22:17:25	henry_92	but you don't do single segment with splits
2015-07-03 22:17:35	happyphotocopy	ugh
2015-07-03 22:17:39	happyphotocopy	i think im confusing segment with split
2015-07-03 22:17:48	mcmitcho	a split is a segment
2015-07-03 22:17:50	happyphotocopy	your splits are where you record each "landmark" you pass in a run
2015-07-03 22:17:51	happyphotocopy	okay
2015-07-03 22:17:56	mcmitcho	splits are the whole run
2015-07-03 22:18:01	mcmitcho	split is the segment
2015-07-03 22:18:06	ski_pants	yeah
2015-07-03 22:18:16	happyphotocopy	i thought a single segment run meant when you did it all at once instead of like building your video out of your best time in each split
2015-07-03 22:18:18	lakilester5626	Segment can also mean when you do the run in pieces. To get a good in-game time.
2015-07-03 22:18:24	happyphotocopy	^
2015-07-03 22:18:24	mcmitcho	oh
2015-07-03 22:18:26	mcmitcho	it is
2015-07-03 22:18:27	happyphotocopy	thats what i thought segments were
2015-07-03 22:18:29	lakilester5626	The speed run community tends to not like it anymore.
2015-07-03 22:18:30	chickenlivernuts	If your best womps fortress time ever was 5:50 and you got a 5:49 it would be gold
2015-07-03 22:18:33	happyphotocopy	ok i think i get it
2015-07-03 22:18:38	happyphotocopy	okay my next question then
2015-07-03 22:18:41	mcmitcho	segmented runs
2015-07-03 22:18:43	lakilester5626	proceed
2015-07-03 22:18:44	happyphotocopy	the first time i run a game
2015-07-03 22:18:44	mcmitcho	are video edited
2015-07-03 22:18:45	thefrostysaiyan	I'll just take your word. I really don't care.
2015-07-03 22:18:45	mcmitcho	together
2015-07-03 22:18:48	happyphotocopy	every single split should be gold right?
2015-07-03 22:18:50	mcmitcho	but knowingly
2015-07-03 22:18:51	henry_92	you're confusing segmented runs with splits
2015-07-03 22:18:52	happyphotocopy	cause its my first time
2015-07-03 22:18:56	mcmitcho	if you try and cheat, we call it a splice
2015-07-03 22:18:56	happyphotocopy	there's no previous numbers right?
2015-07-03 22:19:00	xelmeryx	lol
2015-07-03 22:19:00	mcmitcho	and say its a single segment
2015-07-03 22:19:01	f3rr3t	***
2015-07-03 22:19:06	lakilester5626	correct
2015-07-03 22:19:15	happyphotocopy	ok thats good
2015-07-03 22:19:16	ethyncd	ay
2015-07-03 22:19:22	lakilester5626	All the splits would be the fastest by default.
2015-07-03 22:19:23	henry_92	it won't show it as gold if you don't have anything to compare
2015-07-03 22:19:23	happyphotocopy	i never understood where the numbers on the right of the splits came from
2015-07-03 22:19:24	happyphotocopy	now i do
2015-07-03 22:19:26	chickenlivernuts	I think the splits would just be white considering the program but you could consider them all gold
2015-07-03 22:19:27	happyphotocopy	thanks guys
2015-07-03 22:19:30	mcmitcho	np
2015-07-03 22:19:34	henry_92	but technically yes, your first run is all oglds
2015-07-03 22:19:36	henry_92	golds*
2015-07-03 22:19:44	happyphotocopy	henry_92, okay well, then on my second run, those splits from the first run would be the numbers to the right of my splits after that right?
2015-07-03 22:19:53	lakilester5626	exactly
2015-07-03 22:19:54	mcmitcho	well people save golds
2015-07-03 22:19:55	mcmitcho	on failed runs
2015-07-03 22:19:58	henry_92	yes
2015-07-03 22:20:00	happyphotocopy	true
2015-07-03 22:20:07	mcmitcho	so if you dont finish your first run
2015-07-03 22:20:07	happyphotocopy	im not assuming that in reality i will complete my first attempt
2015-07-03 22:20:09	mcmitcho	they might not be
2015-07-03 22:20:11	henry_92	on your second run everytime you save time it's gold
2015-07-03 22:20:13	happyphotocopy	im just trying to keep it simple
2015-07-03 22:20:15	happyphotocopy	for my understanding
2015-07-03 22:20:24	chickenlivernuts	are you going to run this game?
2015-07-03 22:20:28	happyphotocopy	no lol
2015-07-03 22:20:38	happyphotocopy	im just asking a fairly busy twitch chat of a runner
2015-07-03 22:20:38	henry_92	but then again, gold splits, sum of best and shit like this get sense once you do a lot of runs
2015-07-03 22:20:46	chickenlivernuts	70 star is pretty easy to learn :)
2015-07-03 22:20:48	lakilester5626	Usernames are cool. I like how a lot of them come with a story.
2015-07-03 22:21:03	markusman64ds	My username story
2015-07-03 22:21:06	markusman64ds	I was 7
2015-07-03 22:21:10	mcmitcho	siglemic was sigs school username lol
2015-07-03 22:21:12	happyphotocopy	ChickenLiverNuts, im not really interested in running console games cause if i get serious i have to shell out $$$ when i wanna move from emulator to console
2015-07-03 22:21:13	markusman64ds	and got excited for the DS
2015-07-03 22:21:19	lakilester5626	uh-huh
2015-07-03 22:21:21	markusman64ds	and when I got the DS I needed a username
2015-07-03 22:21:23	happyphotocopy	id rather run a pc game
2015-07-03 22:21:25	markusman64ds	and here we are today
2015-07-03 22:21:27	markusman64ds	***
2015-07-03 22:21:33	lakilester5626	Cool story, bro.
2015-07-03 22:21:35	chickenlivernuts	i run 70 on emu but im a filthy casual :(
2015-07-03 22:21:36	happyphotocopy	because in having a pc i already have everything i need
2015-07-03 22:21:36	henry_92	10/10 story

2015-07-03 22:21:55	lakilester5626	Every time an emote is banned, I think someone is swearing at me.
2015-07-03 22:21:56	fermentwyne	all I ever run is sm64 and oot, easy games to run and very fun

2015-07-03 22:22:03	fermentwyne	but then again I havent ran in forever
2015-07-03 22:22:04	mcmitcho	just run on emu if you want to but dont have money
2015-07-03 22:22:05	happyphotocopy	old consoles and games are expensive, especially if you play an rpg or something and need a japanese cart
2015-07-03 22:22:06	xelmeryx	with "el" being the spañish of "the"
2015-07-03 22:22:08	happyphotocopy	anyway
2015-07-03 22:22:09	mcmitcho	its not looked down upon
2015-07-03 22:22:11	xelmeryx	with x's on the sides
2015-07-03 22:22:12	mcmitcho	or anything
2015-07-03 22:22:17	lakilester5626	That's cool!
2015-07-03 22:22:21	happyphotocopy	im pretty sure ive settled on my first game

2015-07-03 22:22:35	happyphotocopy	im just gonna study it for a while and then dive in
2015-07-03 22:22:35	simpleflips	 Whoosh
2015-07-03 22:22:37	chickenlivernuts	When i was 12 i needed a username for Battlefield 1942.  I always made stupid random names for everything but i stuck with this one ever since
2015-07-03 22:22:38	henry_92	run on emu to have fun, if you want to be competitive then get console
2015-07-03 22:22:47	mcmitcho	what game
2015-07-03 22:22:53	lakilester5626	I don't actually have a cool story. It's just my favorite video game character plus an arbitrary number.
2015-07-03 22:22:54	f3rr3t	and remember, vc is for cheaters
2015-07-03 22:22:56	f3rr3t	***

2015-07-03 22:23:12	mcmitcho	well you dont need an emu but you need a good computer i guess lol
2015-07-03 22:23:17	happyphotocopy	i have a good computer
2015-07-03 22:23:22	mcmitcho	ez
2015-07-03 22:23:23	nonalooloo	tiglemic my diglemic
2015-07-03 22:23:24	henry_92	no one cares about you if you play on n64 and have 2:10 on 120
2015-07-03 22:23:32	tyler9698	oooo snap
2015-07-03 22:23:35	happyphotocopy	thats why im saying id be more interested in running pc games
2015-07-03 22:23:38	happyphotocopy	cause i already have a great pc
2015-07-03 22:23:43	happyphotocopy	buying old consoles and games can be expensive
2015-07-03 22:23:46	biinnys_bazooka	OMG... No... This can't be.... Is it?
2015-07-03 22:23:46	happyphotocopy	:(
2015-07-03 22:23:47	lakilester5626	portal speed runs are pretty dope
2015-07-03 22:23:48	biinnys_bazooka	SIGLEEEEEEMIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2015-07-03 22:23:59	nonalooloo	did he win?
2015-07-03 22:23:59	mcmitcho	im just saying like if you wanted to run sm64 and dont wanna buy an n64, emu is a good choice
2015-07-03 22:24:00	fermentwyne	honestly, run whatever game you like the most
2015-07-03 22:24:04	fermentwyne	caise you'll get sick of it
2015-07-03 22:24:05	happyphotocopy	lakilester5626, yeah it looks a bit hard for a first game
2015-07-03 22:24:10	lakilester5626	True.
2015-07-03 22:24:23	happyphotocopy	mcmitcho, nah im not actually much interested in sm64 im just here cause i picked a speedrun stream to ask my questions in lmao
2015-07-03 22:24:31	markusman64ds	What RGB monitor do you use Sig?
2015-07-03 22:24:35	regular__dude	hey yall gibeDu
2015-07-03 22:24:37	mcmitcho	but sm64 is the best speed gaem
2015-07-03 22:24:39	hooleean	the comeback 
2015-07-03 22:24:41	siglemic	pvm 20l2
2015-07-03 22:24:44	chickenlivernuts	maybe if you never played it before, i grew up with n64 stuff so it maybe was easier for me
2015-07-03 22:24:45	light4258	speed running is like drugs, you cant stop. Even if you quit a year later you will come back and do it again
2015-07-03 22:24:46	s3man	don't speedrun cuz it's a waste of life
2015-07-03 22:24:47	markusman64ds	Cool
2015-07-03 22:24:49	fermentwyne	sm64 is an easy game to learn, honestly
2015-07-03 22:24:50	nonalooloo	is he zzzzz?
2015-07-03 22:24:55	happyphotocopy	mcmitcho, yeah but coming into a sm64 runners' stream of course you guys will say that lmao
2015-07-03 22:25:00	mcmitcho	im just messin
2015-07-03 22:25:04	happyphotocopy	fermentwyne, lol i believe you!

2015-07-03 22:25:20	swissqwertz	is he zzZ? :O
2015-07-03 22:25:25	happyphotocopy	fermentwyne, i just think finding the hardware if i get serious and wanna move to console is hard
2015-07-03 22:25:26	tyler9698	do no reset 120 timed playthrough ;)
2015-07-03 22:25:29	happyphotocopy	SwissQwertz, well mario is yeah
2015-07-03 22:25:42	swissqwertz	buffQT 
2015-07-03 22:25:49	happyphotocopy	fermentwyne, i mean, if I was opening myself up to playing console games id probably run SMRPG before I'd run this
2015-07-03 22:25:51	mcmitcho	do timed play through were you try to get your best time with resets ***
2015-07-03 22:26:02	happyphotocopy	mcmitcho, talking to me?
2015-07-03 22:26:10	lakilester5626	@S3man Well, "waste of life" is objective. The purpose of life is to have happiness. If playing old games 8 hours a day is what makes trihex or Sig or anyone else happy, that's them living their life to the fullest.
2015-07-03 22:26:10	mcmitcho	nah im joking around lol
2015-07-03 22:26:22	mcmitcho	i forgot to add 120 in there
2015-07-03 22:26:22	happyphotocopy	mcmitcho, whats the censored word there?
2015-07-03 22:26:28	mcmitcho	k a p p  a
2015-07-03 22:26:31	happyphotocopy	lakilester5626, i think he was being sarcastic
2015-07-03 22:26:34	henry_92	the censored word was KappaPride uncolored
2015-07-03 22:26:37	siglemic	playing games all day is a better existence than most
2015-07-03 22:26:44	happyphotocopy	Siglemic, yeah dude
2015-07-03 22:26:44	mcmitcho	ohhh a loophole KappaPride

2015-07-03 22:27:19	mcmitcho	video games rot your brain KappaPride
2015-07-03 22:27:21	lakilester5626	Pewdiepie made over 20 million dollars in 2014. Nothing lame about that, lol
2015-07-03 22:27:23	chickenlivernuts	@Lakilester5626 way i think about it is:  Wanting to play games in your free time vs other people worried about what you do in your free time.
2015-07-03 22:27:30	happyphotocopy	okay guys
2015-07-03 22:27:34	happyphotocopy	i was thinking
2015-07-03 22:27:38	lakilester5626	yes?
2015-07-03 22:27:40	balatee	nah pewdiepie is pretty fkin lame
2015-07-03 22:27:43	happyphotocopy	with dishonored i could start out by learning to run one of the DLCs
2015-07-03 22:27:45	happyphotocopy	since they're way shorter
2015-07-03 22:27:46	regular__dude	only a matter of time before kappapride is banished gibeOops
2015-07-03 22:27:46	lakilester5626	@Chickenlivernuts Haha
2015-07-03 22:27:49	happyphotocopy	and i can see if i like it
2015-07-03 22:27:57	happyphotocopy	and then move to the full game if i do?
2015-07-03 22:28:01	mcmitcho	well if you want to run a certain category
2015-07-03 22:28:04	mcmitcho	you should start with that
2015-07-03 22:28:04	lakilester5626	gibeOops
2015-07-03 22:28:05	happyphotocopy	do you think that is reasonable?
2015-07-03 22:28:12	happyphotocopy	or should i just dive in the full game
2015-07-03 22:28:12	mcmitcho	and try small parts of it
2015-07-03 22:28:12	ab49k	Pewdipie is amazing. I personally freakin hate him, but damn, that guy can make the dosh.
2015-07-03 22:28:14	mcmitcho	just learning
2015-07-03 22:28:26	lakilester5626	Markiplier's cool though, right?
2015-07-03 22:28:30	mcmitcho	different categories can differ a bit
2015-07-03 22:28:31	happyphotocopy	mcmitcho, yeah i guess that makes a lot of sense too haha
2015-07-03 22:28:36	lakilester5626	He's like a low level millionaire.
2015-07-03 22:28:39	mcmitcho	some have really specific glitches

2015-07-03 22:28:53	henry_92	i don't think that dishonored has a lot of categories
2015-07-03 22:28:53	happyphotocopy	mcmitcho, yeah one of the really cool things ive noticed about dishonored's categories is the different categories are all within a few minutes of each other

2015-07-04 01:43:07	cutterthemaker	SM64    For the next 2 months I'm putting my free time into SM64. The first month will be focused on learning optimizations and course RTA practice (to catch up with today's strategies). Feel free to not even watch at this time, it'll be very boring with a lot of breaks.    The next month or following months I'll do a lot of runs to update my PB and bop some times. Stay tuned.
2015-07-04 01:43:16	cutterthemaker	reason long breaks i guess

2015-07-04 02:33:48	zodiacsmash	the emulator just has to be better optimized
2015-07-04 02:33:53	zodiacsmash	and people also need better pc's
2015-07-04 02:34:25	gull_ssbm	Framerate is rock solid for me apart from FoD, but yes I do agree that I should just upgrade
2015-07-04 02:34:49	imglower	someone told me there are possibly 256 possible inputs (control stick)
2015-07-04 02:35:00	imglower	and that is the restriction
2015-07-04 02:35:16	imglower	257 if you include neutral
2015-07-04 02:35:39	zodiacsmash	I can see there being that many inputs but not directions.
2015-07-04 02:35:56	wackzor	rip
2015-07-04 02:36:02	imglower	how many directions would you guess?
2015-07-04 02:36:07	imglower	it's not infinity lol

2015-07-04 02:36:09	siglemic	honestly

2015-07-04 02:36:34	zodiacsmash	its almost always ok for me.

2015-07-04 02:38:14	imglower	ik ur busy sig, but do u know?
2015-07-04 02:38:20	gull_ssbm	Its okay once its loaded in, but the map loading in can cause a bit of slowdown for me, but I am on a laptop
2015-07-04 02:38:31	imglower	how many possible control stick inputs you can press
2015-07-04 02:38:32	gull_ssbm	Everything else is completely fine
2015-07-04 02:38:47	gull_ssbm	Its just the water reflection I think
2015-07-04 02:39:24	nox_7	so this smasher around where i like "salty cracker" is a pretty good ganon main now
2015-07-04 02:39:56	nox_7	probably the only ganon i know besides Izayah

2015-07-04 02:40:48	siglemic	which leads me to believe it's this guy
2015-07-04 02:41:00	nox_7	Izayah beat me at this fraudulent high school only tournament

2015-07-04 02:55:07	stealthyduc	sm64 dlc?
2015-07-04 02:55:24	horriblejoysticks	I just don't like the way he plays

2015-07-04 02:55:31	siglemic	all you have to do to beat ganon is not be a retard and hit your techs

2015-07-04 02:57:13	zodiacsmash	Yea pretty much, I just like going in and ganon is like "don't"
2015-07-04 02:57:15	zodiacsmash	the character just irritates me.
2015-07-04 02:57:24	siglemic	yeah because he's a gimmick
2015-07-04 02:57:32	zodiacsmash	Yuuuup
2015-07-04 02:58:02	zodiacsmash	I don't even know how you can play fox on netplay
2015-07-04 02:58:07	zodiacsmash	I gave up on that.
2015-07-04 02:59:38	horriblejoysticks	I tried manning fox but my hands aren't fast enough
2015-07-04 02:59:43	siglemic	im a fox main
2015-07-04 02:59:44	horriblejoysticks	Maining
2015-07-04 02:59:49	siglemic	it feels like any other character
2015-07-04 03:00:19	zodiacsmash	I used to main fox but he is too hard to keep consistent around here, there are just not enough people to practice against.
2015-07-04 03:00:39	horriblejoysticks	Where?
2015-07-04 03:01:32	zodiacsmash	central oregon
2015-07-04 03:01:55	zodiacsmash	It is one of the only places in oregon where there is little to no melee scene
2015-07-04 03:02:21	horriblejoysticks	I have the same problem where I am. Not many people play and even less that are good.
2015-07-04 03:02:31	siglemic	seeing as i already did the tech skill grind, there is no reason not to play fox
2015-07-04 03:02:50	zodiacsmash	I should just put in three hours of fox a day on 20xx and I would be back to form with him.
2015-07-04 03:03:38	gigglesthetapeworm	boy do I love losing on stream
2015-07-04 03:04:11	rensschonenberg	mario??
2015-07-04 03:04:21	zodiacsmash	Losing on stream is the same as losing off stream
2015-07-04 03:04:30	horriblejoysticks	It's just losing
2015-07-04 03:04:42	zodiacsmash	there's no one that goes "That guy lost on stream so he must extra suck."
2015-07-04 03:04:53	light4258	Lol that is a great line

2015-07-04 03:08:44	horriblejoysticks	Lol
2015-07-04 03:08:52	zodiacsmash	Even if you are bizzaro or kage, your still playing ganon.
2015-07-04 03:09:32	zodiacsmash	Ganon is just good enough to be annoying.

2015-07-04 03:12:07	7errac0r3	hardcore mario practice ***
2015-07-04 03:12:09	zodiacsmash	The big problem with fox vs ganon is that ganon outranges fox, which is probably the most irritating part.
2015-07-04 03:12:36	zodiacsmash	not to mention shield stun, I always feel like I should be able to punish ganon for big moves on shield but the stun and push away prevents it.

2015-07-04 04:42:37	ngburns1	i feel like 80% of melee smashers are only going through a phase
2015-07-04 04:42:57	siglemic	what kind of phase
2015-07-04 04:42:58	ngburns1	then they move onto smash 4 or another fighting game

2015-07-04 04:43:15	v1nc3b	the day I'd touch Smash 4 (after 2 years of Melee) ima kill myself
2015-07-04 04:43:17	siglemic	a lot of ppl are melee 4 lyfe
2015-07-04 04:43:23	zodiacsmash	^
2015-07-04 04:43:47	zodiacsmash	I like smash 4 and play it sometimes, but I don't think I could be serious about it.
2015-07-04 04:44:03	ngburns1	sure there are serious melee players
2015-07-04 04:44:29	siglemic	maybe you are the one going through a phase
2015-07-04 04:44:31	ngburns1	but they are among the vast majority of less serious competitive smashers
2015-07-04 04:44:45	siglemic	what do you mean by serious?
2015-07-04 04:45:04	siglemic	like people who don't intend to become a top competitor?
2015-07-04 04:45:09	ngburns1	like vgbootcamp serious
2015-07-04 04:45:27	siglemic	i don't get what you mean
2015-07-04 04:45:29	siglemic	you're talking bullshit
2015-07-04 04:45:36	ngburns1	or just in general, ppl that try to get better
2015-07-04 04:45:43	siglemic	oh right
2015-07-04 04:45:57	gigglesthetapeworm	I get what you're saying, but that number is definitely not 80%
2015-07-04 04:45:57	siglemic	yeah there's a lot of guys locally here who just, kinda play and don't really care how they place, and just wanna hang out
2015-07-04 04:46:29	ngburns1	the ppl that play melee and claim to know matchups
2015-07-04 04:46:36	siglemic	it's actually pretty rare to meet people who are serious
2015-07-04 04:46:47	dangerouskate	The only melee successor is melee hd
2015-07-04 04:46:47	siglemic	like "melee is my life" serious
2015-07-04 04:48:01	ngburns1	maybe its more like 50%
2015-07-04 04:48:08	zodiacsmash	^True, I have only met a few people like that.
2015-07-04 04:48:12	v1nc3b	Think of the goldmine Nintendo is sitting on...

2015-07-04 04:48:24	zodiacsmash	Nintendo doesn't want to mine the gold though
2015-07-04 04:48:28	zodiacsmash	cause their nintendo.

2015-07-04 04:48:41	zodiacsmash	and they make bad decisions for no reason.
2015-07-04 04:48:48	ngburns1	it's hard to step out of my own experience b/c i played melee competitively in college
2015-07-04 04:48:59	kinglucky5	I just came here, what's happening?
2015-07-04 04:48:59	ngburns1	and no one i used to know plays anymore
2015-07-04 04:49:14	gigglesthetapeworm	flame war
2015-07-04 04:49:25	kinglucky5	And in the stream?
2015-07-04 04:49:46	v1nc3b	If only I wasnt still hooked on their 14-17 year old products :(
2015-07-04 04:49:46	dangerouskate	Technically there is melee HD with emulation but HD melee would make it so accessible and refresh the game
2015-07-04 04:49:51	gigglesthetapeworm	I think he's afk
2015-07-04 04:49:58	schlappoyo	140 people watching blackscreen _D
2015-07-04 04:49:59	kinglucky5	Allright
2015-07-04 04:50:08	zodiacsmash	Melee hd isn't lag free like people keep claiming.
2015-07-04 04:50:18	dangerouskate	For me it is
2015-07-04 04:50:28	kinglucky5	heey
2015-07-04 04:50:30	zodiacsmash	Trust me, its not lag free.
2015-07-04 04:50:52	dangerouskate	It just ups the resolution I tested it with the in game calculator
2015-07-04 04:50:55	zodiacsmash	You can get the best adapter and monitor but it still won't be lag free
2015-07-04 04:51:00	v1nc3b	^
2015-07-04 04:51:20	zodiacsmash	We still have some work to do before it can be considered reliable for tournament use.
2015-07-04 04:51:27	zodiacsmash	and even then most people will flat out refuse to play on it

2015-07-04 04:52:23	hafus	sdi up airs is hard on netplay

2015-07-04 04:52:47	hafus	tru dat
2015-07-04 04:52:51	siglemic	its in marths favor if he can sdi them
2015-07-04 04:52:53	siglemic	imo
2015-07-04 04:53:04	zodiacsmash	I find netplay almost impossible to play on with even 50% of normal skill
2015-07-04 04:53:11	hafus	i can agree with that, a really good marth is hard unless you are a really really good fox lol
2015-07-04 04:53:21	siglemic	it might be your ping spiking zodiac
2015-07-04 04:53:35	siglemic	every couple seconds i got this framerate lag with you, and it really made the game way less playable
2015-07-04 04:53:54	siglemic	i think with 2 buffer 60fps there's really not much to complain about
2015-07-04 04:53:56	zodiacsmash	Even if it isn't spiking and its smooth I just can't really get my characters to do what I want them to do on netplay.
2015-07-04 04:55:19	zodiacsmash	I would love 2 buffer
2015-07-04 04:55:42	ab49k	Sig, do you still plan on getting back into SM64 like the good old days? xD
2015-07-04 04:55:44	zodiacsmash	I was playing netplay back when getting 5 buffer was the best we could possibly hope for
2015-07-04 04:55:49	v1nc3b	one upside from living in a country like the Netherlands
2015-07-04 04:56:15	v1nc3b	mostly all the people I play from Europe are 17-30 ping, buffer 2 all the way Kreygasm

2015-07-04 04:57:32	siglemic	mofat do u use wiiu  adapter
2015-07-04 04:57:34	kinglucky5	what's the difference between DI and SDI?
2015-07-04 04:57:41	zodiacsmash	Yea I do
2015-07-04 04:57:47	v1nc3b	you can have a crappy internet speed and still be able to netplay with someone fine
2015-07-04 04:58:03	v1nc3b	you dont want dial-up but the distance between 2 parties is way way more important
2015-07-04 04:58:17	yamithelock	is Sig gonna eventually play SM 64?

2015-07-04 05:34:40	zodiacsmash	The problem is he is playing  falco, the character that gets all things for free and never has to work for anything.

2015-07-04 05:38:14	siglemic	idk. because there's input lag, you can get some openings through doing unsolid things

The first month will be focused on learning optimizations and course RTA practice (to catch up with today's strategies). Feel free to not even watch at this time, it'll be very boring with a lot of breaks.The next month or following months I'll do a lot of runs to update my PB and bop some times. Stay tuned. ***

2015-07-07 04:25:41	siglemic	the one i'm sending you probably has anti aliasing off but you can just turn it on
2015-07-07 04:25:50	siglemic	but the settings are good

2015-07-07 06:19:46	fatgoku	playing falco is like call of duty because he has a gun
2015-07-07 06:19:47	themascarasnake1	quake a best
2015-07-07 06:19:55	tracedout	counterstrike is a really good fps if you like camping and boring games
2015-07-07 06:20:07	d4_scavenger	cs is boring as hell imo
2015-07-07 06:20:12	midni9ht	Don't forget he can use an exo shield Goku.
2015-07-07 06:20:23	themascarasnake1	i like projectiles in FPS
2015-07-07 06:20:29	lordratatosk1	cs is more strategic than cod ***
2015-07-07 06:20:33	themascarasnake1	counter strike lacks them except for nades, which are actually really neat, especially smokes
2015-07-07 06:20:44	themascarasnake1	but CS definitely isn't my preferred FPS
2015-07-07 06:20:49	fatgoku	thats a good point midnight. also in the newest (best) cod you have a double jump like this game
2015-07-07 06:21:01	d4_scavenger	***
2015-07-07 06:21:02	purpole	yeah, thats why call of duty is so good, so many flashy lights and cool noises and explosions

2015-07-07 06:21:27	midni9ht	Not to mention that you can select different outfits as well!
2015-07-07 06:21:42	themascarasnake1	call of duty is the best because you get to hide behind a rock to get your health back for free
2015-07-07 06:21:45	midni9ht	When's DLC though? :/

2015-07-07 06:37:17	phoenonxxx	Marth is so crisp in Melee, what happened to you in Smash 4 man, you got fat
2015-07-07 06:37:22	midni9ht	If only I lived in USA. There's only like 1 major / minor tournament every 6 months or so in my country. :(

2015-07-07 06:45:08	supersapphire	i like how the in game crowd sounds so much louder since theirs no click sounds from the controllers
2015-07-07 06:45:48	fliinchy	this falco needs to practice more.
2015-07-07 06:46:21	phoenonxxx	Ahah that Side B
2015-07-07 06:46:39	phoenonxxx	Maybe roll less predictably too
2015-07-07 06:46:45	fliinchy	spacing is decent,  just needs tech skill

2015-07-07 09:10:22	ascendedwithin	yeah
2015-07-07 09:10:28	failinator	I'd say above average, but I'm not good enough to tell
2015-07-07 09:10:30	jacopb	he's good
2015-07-07 09:10:40	jacopb	def above average
2015-07-07 09:11:19	dumbhero	is his Fox like mang0 and leffen's level of play or?
2015-07-07 09:11:30	failinator	unlikely
2015-07-07 09:11:48	dumbhero	you're probably right
2015-07-07 09:11:56	failinator	that's a different league
2015-07-07 09:12:06	failinator	Sig is on a good way though :>
2015-07-07 09:12:19	failinator	I think he needs more people to play with though
2015-07-07 09:12:26	dumbhero	but if he plays Melee like he speedruns, good enough imo
2015-07-07 09:12:38	failinator	tourney experience is really valueable
2015-07-07 09:12:51	theredsock	He's very technical but lacks a lot of the high level fundamentals in spacing and neutral game
2015-07-07 09:13:00	dumbhero	it's hard to practice this game without tourneys/ other people who play

2015-07-07 09:23:27	dumbhero	ohhh
2015-07-07 09:23:33	princesstyphoon	you're not enjoying dark souls?
2015-07-07 09:23:44	caysekong	youre kinda stuck in it
2015-07-07 09:23:54	fatgoku	no I'm loving it, but siglemic kept telling me once I beat 3 bosses the game gets way better
2015-07-07 09:25:20	failinator	that recovery :O
2015-07-07 09:25:44	failinator	btw is this netplay or local?
2015-07-07 09:25:54	fatgoku	local
2015-07-07 09:26:05	dumbhero	His Samus is pretty good
2015-07-07 09:26:14	fatgoku	dont encourage him
2015-07-07 09:26:44	dumbhero	G could be using that shine though
2015-07-07 09:27:03	killerdj321	is g google ?
2015-07-07 09:28:00	dumbhero	this music reminds me minecraft in a way
2015-07-07 09:28:31	fatgoku	HHH
2015-07-07 09:28:33	fatgoku	OHHH*
2015-07-07 09:28:41	failinator	triLewd
2015-07-07 09:28:45	princesstyphoon	lmao
2015-07-07 09:29:00	dumbhero	the shield break ***
2015-07-07 09:30:00	bib691	G is kinda meh..
2015-07-07 09:30:09	fatgoku	he's pretty new bib
2015-07-07 09:30:28	bib691	K sry
2015-07-07 09:30:33	failinator	my friend calls Samus "missile whore" for a reason, that spam was... triLewd
2015-07-07 09:30:43	princesstyphoon	***
2015-07-07 09:30:56	failinator	FatGoku how new are we talking?
2015-07-07 09:31:01	hopanon	All these zairs
2015-07-07 09:31:02	brandoisbae	Two SDs thats rough
2015-07-07 09:31:08	fatgoku	I am not sure, maybe a couple months
2015-07-07 09:31:10	dumbhero	he shouldn't be afraid to try faster movement with combos though
2015-07-07 09:31:42	failinator	hmm, his performance looks better than what I could do in a couple of months, probably
2015-07-07 09:31:52	failinator	but then again, I've never tried hard
2015-07-07 09:32:31	dumbhero	his edge play could use a little more practice
2015-07-07 09:33:25	princesstyphoon	I don't even know what's going on
2015-07-07 09:34:30	failinator	so, is it just me or is Marth a very hard matchup for a beginner? I struggle a lot against him
2015-07-07 09:35:12	fatgoku	marth's a hard match up for everyone
2015-07-07 09:35:22	dumbhero	a good Marth is a hard matchup for basically anyone
2015-07-07 09:35:48	failinator	good to know :) also Marth vs Marth just feels stupid :P
2015-07-07 09:35:56	fatgoku	his range can also be really hard to deal with if you're new
2015-07-07 09:36:07	failinator	yea, his range and grab are my issues
2015-07-07 09:36:26	dumbhero	just avoid the tip lol
2015-07-07 09:36:42	failinator	easier said than done triWaifu
2015-07-07 09:36:52	dumbhero	I know ***
2015-07-07 09:36:58	fatgoku	just the tip? ***
2015-07-07 09:37:29	dumbhero	I was joking lol
2015-07-07 09:38:15	ldenshou	Evo soooon hype
2015-07-07 09:40:22	zaru7t10	Faaalco
2015-07-07 09:41:54	failinator	G doesn't seem to use grabs very often
2015-07-07 09:42:06	dumbhero	I was thinking the same
2015-07-07 09:42:59	dumbhero	he could really take advantage of grabbing when Sig shields
2015-07-07 09:43:09	failinator	well, I don't know how effective grabs are against Samus
2015-07-07 09:43:09	dumbhero	like that ***
2015-07-07 09:44:12	swissqwertz	Sig no SM64 anymore?
2015-07-07 09:44:17	dumbhero	if you can follow up with the throw you're golden
2015-07-07 09:44:39	swissqwertz	And why no mic? :O
2015-07-07 09:45:05	failinator	Sig doesn't use mic often, at least from my experience
2015-07-07 09:45:19	dumbhero	does he still ace those 120 star runs?
2015-07-07 09:47:04	jp1_	Song Kreygasm
2015-07-07 09:48:34	dumbhero	I noticed G doesn't use up air
2015-07-07 09:51:01	chansey_nes	tell him to tech instead of always roleing towards you
2015-07-07 09:51:38	dumbhero	his Sheik isn't too bad
2015-07-07 09:51:57	chansey_nes	his wavelanding still needs practice
2015-07-07 09:52:13	chansey_nes	his spaceing is ok
2015-07-07 09:52:14	dumbhero	true
2015-07-07 09:52:21	skumbagdevo	isn't G bored of playing against sig ?
2015-07-07 09:52:32	failinator	why would he get bored?
2015-07-07 09:52:37	dumbhero	doubt it
2015-07-07 09:52:46	chansey_nes	melee too fun
2015-07-07 09:52:55	dumbhero	^
2015-07-07 09:53:08	chansey_nes	20xx?
2015-07-07 09:53:11	failinator	I think it would be very exciting to play Sig, since he's better than me. You'll only learn from stronger opponents
2015-07-07 09:53:28	failinator	or at least you learn more
2015-07-07 09:53:29	chansey_nes	not true, but you learn more
2015-07-07 09:54:00	chansey_nes	learning patterns is fine against worse players because it´s easier to see
2015-07-07 09:54:21	chansey_nes	you need to be able to punish as hard as possible with a read
2015-07-07 09:54:50	chansey_nes	like G´s no teching and same role pattern every time
2015-07-07 09:55:06	failinator	yea...I'm not good at punishing. Like, at all
2015-07-07 09:55:18	orlyfalcon	sig playing sheik now?  ***
2015-07-07 09:55:28	chansey_nes	yep and that is fine to learn with more even opponents
2015-07-07 09:55:45	chansey_nes	because better players apply too much preassure to think about it
2015-07-07 09:55:47	failinator	not so much with CPUs :/
2015-07-07 09:55:49	pizzaman408	anyone wanna netplay XD? EC
2015-07-07 09:56:08	chansey_nes	CPUs are just silly so don´t learn with them
2015-07-07 09:56:26	chansey_nes	unlees it´s changrabs you can practice on lvlv 4 CPUs
2015-07-07 09:56:28	failinator	yea, that's why I can't get good at Melee, nobody to play with triLewd
2015-07-07 09:56:58	tomaster1275	There are plenty of melee tourneys
2015-07-07 09:57:03	dumbhero	or practicing DI techs
2015-07-07 09:57:06	failinator	not in my area :/
2015-07-07 09:57:18	chansey_nes	what is your area?
2015-07-07 09:57:23	tomaster1275	Then move to a different area ;P
2015-07-07 09:57:26	failinator	Bavaria, Germany
2015-07-07 09:57:42	tomaster1275	o
2015-07-07 09:57:56	chansey_nes	there should be some locals in germany
2015-07-07 09:57:57	failinator	the south of Bavaria has an active scene, somewhat at least, but I'm far in the north of it :/
2015-07-07 09:58:26	tomaster1275	If ur old enough u could try to look for people in your area to play with
2015-07-07 09:58:30	tomaster1275	Doesn't have to be in tourneys
2015-07-07 09:58:34	dumbhero	save money for some locals
2015-07-07 09:58:44	failinator	yea, money is a big issue
2015-07-07 09:59:02	dumbhero	Trust me I know
2015-07-07 09:59:16	tomaster1275	Get ur friends to start playing :P
2015-07-07 09:59:31	failinator	like, the big tourney in Munich would be doable, but 130 bucks + traveling costs is simply too much
2015-07-07 10:00:06	tomaster1275	130 bucks to participate?
2015-07-07 10:00:20	failinator	I think that's entry and stay for 2 nights
2015-07-07 10:00:32	tomaster1275	Oh
2015-07-07 10:00:39	failinator	the price is really nice, I just don't have that money :/
2015-07-07 10:00:58	daiske10	Lol,i'm from bavaria
2015-07-07 10:00:59	dumbhero	if it makes you feel better, I'm one of the only two people in my area who play smash at all
2015-07-07 10:01:01	tomaster1275	Get a job lol
2015-07-07 10:01:20	chansey_nes	well danes are lucky at that point because we have an agreement to keep the price low, so it goes from free to like 10 euro
2015-07-07 10:01:33	tomaster1275	Jk
2015-07-07 10:01:38	chansey_nes	+ travel
2015-07-07 10:02:08	tomaster1275	U can also try netplay
2015-07-07 10:02:18	failinator	my internet can't handle netplay, I'm afraid
2015-07-07 10:02:32	daiske10	dou you have a german smash boards account ?
2015-07-07 10:02:52	failinator	no, I thought about it though
2015-07-07 10:03:10	tomaster1275	Smashboards is great
2015-07-07 10:03:13	daiske10	if you want to meet people in your area,do it
2015-07-07 10:03:19	dumbhero	smash boards is great
2015-07-07 10:03:21	daiske10	Germansmash.de
2015-07-07 10:03:25	tomaster1275	If u play smash u should get an account
2015-07-07 10:03:42	daiske10	here you go
2015-07-07 10:03:49	failinator	I have a normal smashboard account, honestly just discovered Germansmash yesterday :P
2015-07-07 10:04:01	daiske10	lawl
2015-07-07 10:04:09	tomaster1275	Haha
2015-07-07 10:04:10	dumbhero	take advantage then lol
2015-07-07 10:04:17	tomaster1275	Is there one for every country?
2015-07-07 10:04:28	chansey_nes	G stop rolling the same way every ime
2015-07-07 10:04:33	chansey_nes	*time
2015-07-07 10:04:43	failinator	not sure Tomaster, but I think there's a site for Europe in total
2015-07-07 10:04:53	tomaster1275	O
2015-07-07 10:05:02	chansey_nes	never seen a europe site
2015-07-07 10:05:15	failinator	maybe that was just the tourney site, I don't remember
2015-07-07 10:05:19	daiske10	i thin the original smashboards is global
2015-07-07 10:05:26	chansey_nes	it is
2015-07-07 10:05:40	chansey_nes	but it might have europe threads
2015-07-07 10:06:17	failinator	I know it features EU tourneys, so most likely threads too
2015-07-07 10:06:22	dumbhero	G side b's too much :/
2015-07-07 10:06:42	chansey_nes	it´s not to side B it´s a tecnical error
2015-07-07 10:06:47	tomaster1275	Sig is really good...
2015-07-07 10:06:49	chansey_nes	instead of doing laser
2015-07-07 10:07:14	chansey_nes	his falco is not that good
2015-07-07 10:07:35	dumbhero	I've seen worse
2015-07-07 10:07:38	tomaster1275	His playstyle is good in general
2015-07-07 10:08:01	chansey_nes	yea it´s his neautral that is better, not the falco
2015-07-07 10:08:13	tomaster1275	And his combo game...
2015-07-07 10:08:14	failinator	I guess my only complaint about Sig's playstyle is that he full-hops a lot (on accident, I assume)
2015-07-07 10:08:30	dumbhero	his combo game needs some work tbh
2015-07-07 10:08:38	chansey_nes	falco vs falco have way more combos than sig is doing
2015-07-07 10:08:38	tomaster1275	Better than mine lol
2015-07-07 10:08:45	whoisjason	sig doesn't have the best punish game
2015-07-07 10:09:00	whoisjason	but he spams tech skill like every other aspiring 20xx wannabe
2015-07-07 10:09:03	whoisjason	***
2015-07-07 10:09:15	bdp2014	Lol
2015-07-07 10:09:33	chansey_nes	my tech skill is for sure worse, but I still pretty sure i can beat Sig
2015-07-07 10:09:47	dumbhero	same
2015-07-07 10:09:49	tomaster1275	Is falco better than fox?
2015-07-07 10:09:58	chansey_nes	combo game yes
2015-07-07 10:10:00	whoisjason	fox arguable has better matchups against the cast
2015-07-07 10:10:02	siglemic	i dont play falco
2015-07-07 10:10:04	chansey_nes	in general no
2015-07-07 10:10:08	whoisjason	so in theory fox is better
2015-07-07 10:10:15	whoisjason	but uhh it doesn't really matter both characters are nuts
2015-07-07 10:10:24	chansey_nes	Yea not suprised your not playing falco
2015-07-07 10:10:39	chansey_nes	was also more the sheik play i judged from
2015-07-07 10:10:40	whoisjason	everyone plays falco or marth nowadays
2015-07-07 10:10:40	bdp2014	But a lot is different
2015-07-07 10:10:41	failinator	now the real question is, when are we gonna see Pichu? ***
2015-07-07 10:10:49	tomaster1275	Fox has more potential but it's impossible to unlock it without TAS
2015-07-07 10:11:05	chansey_nes	or kirby
2015-07-07 10:11:08	whoisjason	the majority of his useful tech skill is doable
2015-07-07 10:11:12	tomaster1275	I see way more top players using falco
2015-07-07 10:11:19	whoisjason	you do?
2015-07-07 10:11:25	failinator	in the year 20XX, we will all have cyborg hands anyway, so TAS is the way to go ***
2015-07-07 10:11:32	whoisjason	mang0 only uses falco for the fox matchup because he dislikes the ditto
2015-07-07 10:11:32	tomaster1275	Like top top
2015-07-07 10:11:36	str8wu	Yooooo
2015-07-07 10:11:39	professorpiglet	i wanna see more than 1 active good pikachu smh
2015-07-07 10:11:50	chansey_nes	well for a TAS bowser is second best
2015-07-07 10:12:04	chansey_nes	maybe 3rd
2015-07-07 10:12:18	whoisjason	I wanna see one decent young link
2015-07-07 10:12:21	tomaster1275	He used falco vs pp
2015-07-07 10:12:35	chansey_nes	don´t wish to see young link
2015-07-07 10:12:42	chansey_nes	armada already showed that
2015-07-07 10:12:47	whoisjason	not well lol
2015-07-07 10:12:50	chansey_nes	and it was ***
2015-07-07 10:12:53	whoisjason	LOL
2015-07-07 10:12:57	whoisjason	did you see axe's yl
2015-07-07 10:13:01	chansey_nes	yes
2015-07-07 10:13:03	professorpiglet	well his fox isnt fairing much better vs puff
2015-07-07 10:13:04	chansey_nes	Kreygasm
2015-07-07 10:13:19	failinator	Young Link gets so much hate, just because Armada stalled out Hbox :/
2015-07-07 10:13:31	chansey_nes	but axe is PogChamp will all
2015-07-07 10:13:36	chansey_nes	*with
2015-07-07 10:13:51	professorpiglet	too bad we never see it
2015-07-07 10:14:29	chansey_nes	yes he rolled the other way
2015-07-07 10:14:37	chansey_nes	and didn´t get punished
2015-07-07 10:14:49	tomaster1275	Falco is better vs Marth than fox, right?
2015-07-07 10:15:27	chansey_nes	dunno
2015-07-07 10:15:29	failinator	I thought Falco vs Marth is a bad matchup
2015-07-07 10:15:45	tomaster1275	On fd for sure
2015-07-07 10:16:01	failinator	FD Marth is so hard to counter >_>
2015-07-07 10:16:10	chansey_nes	well M2K is a beast in that matchup
2015-07-07 10:16:27	tomaster1275	Idk how to chain grab with Marth :(
2015-07-07 10:16:28	chansey_nes	counter it with kirby like hack
2015-07-07 10:16:36	tomaster1275	So hard once it gets to the pivots
2015-07-07 10:16:56	ldenshou	Kirby is the worst character
2015-07-07 10:17:09	chansey_nes	yes but does wel vs marth anyway
2015-07-07 10:17:17	ldenshou	No...
2015-07-07 10:17:23	tomaster1275	Lucky for kirby he had the gift of project m
2015-07-07 10:17:48	chansey_nes	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WR3Z0ecchYc
2015-07-07 10:17:50	chansey_nes	yes
2015-07-07 10:18:16	chansey_nes	pretty sure you can agree ice have a good marth
2015-07-07 10:18:23	tomaster1275	How is kirby worse than pichu?
2015-07-07 10:18:46	chansey_nes	because pichu actually can move...
2015-07-07 10:19:03	tomaster1275	Moving doesn't help if u can't attack :P
2015-07-07 10:19:18	viktoralsos	Pichu actually has ways to approach
2015-07-07 10:19:46	tomaster1275	Honestly I don't get what nintendo was thinking when they made characters like kirby or pichu
2015-07-07 10:19:51	siglemic	mario makes no sense to me
2015-07-07 10:19:53	tomaster1275	Did they make them bad on purpose?
2015-07-07 10:19:56	siglemic	what do you do
2015-07-07 10:19:58	siglemic	as this character
2015-07-07 10:20:06	viktoralsos	Grap
2015-07-07 10:20:09	chansey_nes	they just nerfed kirby too hard from 64
2015-07-07 10:20:09	viktoralsos	Grab
2015-07-07 10:20:11	failinator	fire ball to approach maybe?
2015-07-07 10:20:11	viktoralsos	Alot
2015-07-07 10:20:11	tomaster1275	Down smash
2015-07-07 10:20:25	chansey_nes	upthrow upsmash techchase
2015-07-07 10:20:33	chansey_nes	and yes lot´s of downsmash

2015-07-07 10:26:23	ldenshou	I used to live in Kungsbacka D: Wish I stayed there.
2015-07-07 10:28:34	mezerian	Could try netplay with emulation and stuff, aspinda?
2015-07-07 10:30:14	chansey_nes	Battlefield ***
2015-07-07 10:30:29	failinator	speaking of PAL, I'm currently only playing on PAL. Should I learn NTSC instead? No idea how the scene works in Europe
2015-07-07 10:30:33	chansey_nes	wierdest ledge in game
2015-07-07 10:30:49	chansey_nes	Europe ises PAL
2015-07-07 10:30:52	chansey_nes	*uses
2015-07-07 10:30:59	failinator	what about tourneys though?
2015-07-07 10:31:05	chansey_nes	PAL
2015-07-07 10:31:10	failinator	oh, okay
2015-07-07 10:31:13	failinator	kinda surprising
2015-07-07 10:31:21	chansey_nes	why?
2015-07-07 10:31:24	krissehboy	this is sigs main ***
2015-07-07 10:31:26	chansey_nes	it´s still 60 fps
2015-07-07 10:31:30	failinator	cause PAL is ass
2015-07-07 10:31:35	aspinda	@Mezerian, true! iv never got around to setting it up. might do that today
2015-07-07 10:31:41	nox_7	2 kills from this stitch
2015-07-07 10:31:43	nox_7	christ
2015-07-07 10:32:17	chansey_nes	PAL nerfed fox up b and upsmash, can´t see what is wrong about that
2015-07-07 10:32:37	chansey_nes	also made sheiks throw way less broken
2015-07-07 10:32:49	nox_7	marth changes though :/ got me salty
2015-07-07 10:32:53	chansey_nes	true
2015-07-07 10:33:00	chansey_nes	and kirby ***
2015-07-07 10:33:28	chansey_nes	oh wait it´s in NTSC he´s even worse
2015-07-07 10:33:49	chansey_nes	but ganondorf nerf was sad too
2015-07-07 10:33:51	qberty	why scart
2015-07-07 10:34:08	mezerian	@Aspinda It's surprisingly not too tricky, either. If you have a smash 4 adapter you can even use the GCN controllers no issue.
2015-07-07 10:37:14	aspinda	I have a single adapter for the wiimote but i could invest in the usb one @Mezerian I didnt know there was an adapter that worked on both wii u an computer though
2015-07-07 10:37:24	mellinum_falcon	Hi siglmeic
2015-07-07 10:37:41	mezerian	You need custom drivers, but they work really well.
2015-07-07 10:38:48	nox_7	so i have to confess something, my friends and i were bored, so we tried to make competitive Giant Mode Melee a thing
2015-07-07 10:38:57	nox_7	it gets VERY hype
2015-07-07 10:39:02	nox_7	marth and roy are banned though
2015-07-07 10:39:35	navisly	cause Up A A A A A A A A ? :p
2015-07-07 10:39:49	nox_7	I personally think Falco should be banned as well
2015-07-07 10:40:01	krissehboy	that up smash
2015-07-07 10:40:03	nox_7	but Giant Mode is still fresh and young
2015-07-07 10:40:14	krissehboy	I prefer tiny mode
2015-07-07 10:40:45	pjruscito	Me and a friend did a 26 character giant mode iron man oncxe
2015-07-07 10:40:47	navisly	and what about invisible mode ?
2015-07-07 10:41:04	nox_7	@Pjruscito so you know of the hype that is Giant Mode??? welcome brother
2015-07-07 10:41:29	pjruscito	Giant mode is sick.
2015-07-07 10:41:58	nox_7	Giant mode marth needed to be banned among my friends though
2015-07-07 10:42:05	nox_7	RIP c-stickers

2015-09-24 02:19:12	kusu_	Fuck that.
2015-09-24 02:19:41	colmert	Where can I get this game?
2015-09-24 02:19:49	kusu_	Uhhh.
2015-09-24 02:19:56	gull_ssbm	Ebay now probably
2015-09-24 02:19:58	d3g4d0	I remember when sig played mario 64 BibleThump
2015-09-24 02:19:58	tmshock	amazon
2015-09-24 02:20:04	gull_ssbm	It came out in 2002
2015-09-24 02:20:05	kusu_	I do not condone pirating games such as metroid fusion off of rom websites.
2015-09-24 02:20:22	tmshock	still on amazon xd
2015-09-24 02:20:30	mwhitestonem	wow was it really 2002? I feel old now...
2015-09-24 02:20:39	squrpion	Hey Siglemic ::)
2015-09-24 02:20:43	tmshock	this part sucked, hope sig solves the puzzle here
2015-09-24 02:20:46	colmert	He's playing on pc?
2015-09-24 02:20:54	gull_ssbm	It came out on the same day as Metroid Prime I think... you could link your GBA and get some stuff in Prime
2015-09-24 02:21:05	mwhitestonem	oh no way!
2015-09-24 02:21:06	kusu_	Couldn't you get the mutated suit in prime?
2015-09-24 02:21:08	mwhitestonem	had no idea
2015-09-24 02:21:20	gull_ssbm	Yeah it's weird looking in Prime but the morph ball looked cool
2015-09-24 02:21:27	sulpherv1	I remember when they showed the trailer on the TV lol
2015-09-24 02:21:42	kusu_	Lemmie get this straight
2015-09-24 02:21:43	siglemic	the animals :3
2015-09-24 02:21:48	kusu_	Prime is in a different universe right?
2015-09-24 02:21:49	squrpion	This game looks amazing.
2015-09-24 02:21:50	tmshock	I needed 20min to find this tunnel sig :(
2015-09-24 02:21:50	kusu_	Animals!
2015-09-24 02:21:51	squrpion	lol the animals!
2015-09-24 02:21:55	mwhitestonem	dawww you saved the animals :3
2015-09-24 02:22:09	colmert	So this is on GBA?
2015-09-24 02:22:10	castlewood	save the frames FeelsGoodMan
2015-09-24 02:22:16	kusu_	yeah, colmert
2015-09-24 02:22:24	gull_ssbm	Kusu I think it's all the same universe
2015-09-24 02:22:29	frenzy1272	i still love you siglemic, always #1 in my heart
2015-09-24 02:22:33	kusu_	hmm
2015-09-24 02:22:48	kusu_	I'm not 100% sure, but I was pretty sure prime was a different story altogether.
2015-09-24 02:22:50	colmert	I shouldn't have broken my GBA :(
2015-09-24 02:22:55	kusu_	But who knows
2015-09-24 02:23:22	colmert	I always thought it was a man lol
2015-09-24 02:23:32	kusu_	lel
2015-09-24 02:23:37	pandalasse	Timer? Training?
2015-09-24 02:23:37	gull_ssbm	Good thing Metroid continuity isn't important
2015-09-24 02:23:39	kusu_	And that he was named Metroid
2015-09-24 02:23:49	kusu_	Actually, Metroid has a REALLY cool story
2015-09-24 02:24:12	kusu_	There's comics/mangas and shit.

2015-09-24 02:27:49	armoredfrog	I thought it was Samus Aran-X

2015-09-24 02:27:57	mwhitestonem	like saxophone? Kappa

2015-09-24 02:34:18	mwhitestonem	wouldn't it be cool if Zelda were a grill?

2015-09-24 02:34:52	tmshock	that one is super annoying
2015-09-24 02:34:52	gull_ssbm	If you die here you have to go through all of that shit again
2015-09-24 02:34:59	gull_ssbm	Worst part about this boss
2015-09-24 02:35:07	tmshock	yep
2015-09-24 02:35:12	kusu_	I remember I played this on an emulator..
2015-09-24 02:35:12	boreh32	no pressure though
2015-09-24 02:35:17	kusu_	On a keyboard that couldn't read more than 2 keys at once.
2015-09-24 02:35:22	kusu_	This boss was a fucking nightmare.
2015-09-24 02:35:39	boreh32	yea
2015-09-24 02:35:55	tmshock	sig is too stronk
2015-09-24 02:35:57	danoninolol	Have you ever farted on your hand and smelled it and almost faint cause of it

2015-09-24 02:36:31	kusu_	How is this considered
2015-09-24 02:36:35	kusu_	a good boss
2015-09-24 02:36:38	kusu_	I just don't get it.
2015-09-24 02:36:59	tmshock	first try gg sig
2015-09-24 02:37:03	kusu_	SPACE JUMP
2015-09-24 02:37:16	mwhitestonem	I like the boss music mostly
2015-09-24 02:37:22	arashinokage	Is he planning on speed running this or just playing it?
2015-09-24 02:37:39	kusu_	who knows
2015-09-24 02:37:42	tmshock	is the next boss this phantom nightmare whatever dragon?
2015-09-24 02:37:51	gull_ssbm	I honestly dislike Space Jump in Metroid games because now there's way less platforming
2015-09-24 02:38:13	kusu_	Yeah, but the thing is they only give it towards the end of the game.
2015-09-24 02:38:18	kusu_	It's a feel of power and control over the game.
2015-09-24 02:38:24	kusu_	It's like a..
2015-09-24 02:38:25	brandonhill1993	like castlevania wing etc
2015-09-24 02:38:29	kusu_	"Hey, look how far you've progressed!"
2015-09-24 02:38:32	kusu_	"You're really strong now!"
2015-09-24 02:38:37	kusu_	And I feel it does that job well.
2015-09-24 02:39:13	kusu_	Man, SA-X is like pants on head retarded isn't it.
2015-09-24 02:40:22	siglemic	bye

2015-09-24 02:43:42	zhrchaos	He didn't speak or anything. And he just ended with no warning.
2015-09-24 02:44:11	zhrchaos	I guess he said bye in chat. Is this really what people like to watch?

2015-09-30 01:32:15	universalgiant	part of me wanted to see that clip work just to see if you could escape
2015-09-30 01:33:08	siglemic	this is quite a device
2015-09-30 01:33:29	boreh32	a contraption of a key
2015-09-30 01:33:34	universalgiant	still less complicated than boss keys in other zelda games
2015-09-30 01:33:38	universalgiant	oddly enough
2015-09-30 01:33:39	covykiller	and, if you're brave enough...
2015-09-30 01:33:43	um_screx	It looks like mega thermos

2015-09-30 01:37:06	um_screx	That's some ancient dalek technology right there
2015-09-30 01:38:58	momirstar	GG
2015-09-30 01:39:02	nazzerith	reset
2015-09-30 01:39:02	vash	lol I thought you'd clutch that ledge grab out
2015-09-30 01:39:10	vash	NOPE
2015-09-30 01:39:15	universalgiant	generous respawn
2015-09-30 01:39:24	kabii_sama	Torch Slugs are obnoxious man
2015-09-30 01:39:25	siglemic	there is no penalty to death
2015-09-30 01:39:39	universalgiant	always assumed you had to restart the dungeon
2015-09-30 01:39:45	universalgiant	guess i never bothered to try
2015-09-30 01:39:53	kabii_sama	nah you restart in the same room lol
2015-09-30 01:40:10	kabii_sama	well, in a dungeon that is
2015-09-30 01:40:11	um_screx	This is like smash bros melee close up. The edge guards are real
2015-09-30 01:41:57	um_screx	I wonder if the bow's trahectory is different upside down
2015-09-30 01:42:16	kabii_sama	well it flips your viewpoint anyway
2015-09-30 01:42:20	universalgiant	is the arrow even affected by gravity in this game?
2015-09-30 01:42:37	momirstar	NO
2015-09-30 01:42:41	kabii_sama	yeah, over really long distances the arrows will fall somewhat
2015-09-30 01:42:43	universalgiant	would make the hawkeye kinda pointless
2015-09-30 01:42:53	kabii_sama	mostly only noticable in the open field area
2015-09-30 01:43:09	kabii_sama	*areas
2015-09-30 01:43:51	vash	How you liking the game so far sig?
2015-09-30 01:44:14	siglemic	the beginning was bottom tier
2015-09-30 01:44:17	siglemic	but now its pretty dang good
2015-09-30 01:44:40	vash	Yeah earlier on it dragged but once you get the tunic it picks up for sure ~
2015-09-30 01:45:01	universalgiant	this is one of the slower dungeons too
2015-09-30 01:45:13	vash	this dungeon is very well designed tho
2015-09-30 01:45:14	universalgiant	not that you needed me to tell you that
2015-09-30 01:45:15	kabii_sama	the beginning up until Forest Temple is pretty universally agreed to be very boring
2015-09-30 01:45:20	vash	So it being slow doesnt bother me at least
2015-09-30 01:45:43	universalgiant	i love the design of a lot of these dungeons
2015-09-30 01:45:53	vash	its the equivalent to the roxas segment in KH2
2015-09-30 01:46:08	mc_reind33r	I think my favorite is snowhead
2015-09-30 01:46:15	stickygod	@Vash The Roxas segment wasn't so bad.
2015-09-30 01:46:22	universalgiant	same. snowpeak is so unique
2015-09-30 01:46:24	kaspauf	@Mc_reind33r agreed
2015-09-30 01:47:15	vash	yeah but it dragged, so it's similar I think
2015-09-30 01:47:25	mc_reind33r	Is this sigs first playthrough?
2015-09-30 01:47:37	kabii_sama	the further you get in the game the more stuff opens up to explore, so I'd say by/after a certain point (which I won't spoil) the game really gets fun
2015-09-30 01:47:52	boreh32	yep, first time
2015-09-30 01:48:01	orcastraw	lol
2015-09-30 01:48:21	mc_reind33r	Nice. Well you're in for a good time
2015-09-30 01:49:10	kaspauf	Now the question is... do we ever see Zelda WiiU or will it move to the next console?
2015-09-30 01:49:10	universalgiant	i love how powerful the bow makes you feel
2015-09-30 01:49:29	rellthereal1	I haven't seen this game in years 😢
2015-09-30 01:49:53	mc_reind33r	Omg lol

2015-09-30 01:51:03	kaspauf	I was hoping we would get news on Zelda WiiU at E3 but oh well
2015-09-30 01:51:19	formula91	hype
2015-09-30 01:51:27	boreh32	they are gonna hold out till NX comes out i think
2015-09-30 01:51:35	universalgiant	feels that way
2015-09-30 01:51:36	boreh32	also
2015-09-30 01:51:37	kaspauf	@Boreh32 such a fail....
2015-09-30 01:51:40	boreh32	hype
2015-09-30 01:51:50	universalgiant	music Kreygasm
2015-09-30 01:52:06	um_screx	What the flippidy @$#& is that!?
2015-09-30 01:52:17	vash	This boss is visually pleasing
2015-09-30 01:52:33	professoar	this music is hype a f
2015-09-30 01:52:35	vash	well the fight in its entirety at least

2015-09-30 01:53:58	brackleforth	u got him
2015-09-30 01:54:18	rellthereal1	There ya go
2015-09-30 01:54:23	professoar	rolling is so fluid in this version of the game
2015-09-30 01:54:32	professoar	i mean in this zelda title
2015-09-30 01:54:54	kabii_sama	yeah it's nice how you can change direction mid roll
2015-09-30 01:55:08	professoar	and you dont lose speed between rolls
2015-09-30 01:55:25	kabii_sama	also roll attack Kreygasm
2015-09-30 01:55:27	boreh32	gg
2015-09-30 01:55:30	professoar	its a good thing that they realized everyone who plays zelda does it, and they made it fluid
2015-09-30 01:55:37	professoar	gg
2015-09-30 01:55:39	boreh32	balrog down
2015-09-30 01:55:50	harold574	Love this game Kreygasm
2015-09-30 01:56:06	brackleforth	switching to a sprint mechanic in SS actually felt like a downgrade imo
2015-09-30 01:56:16	professoar	i like the story in this game too. its the only zelda game where ssomething happened that i didnt expect
2015-09-30 01:56:24	professoar	not gonna go into detail
2015-09-30 01:56:36	universalgiant	i recall it surprising me too
2015-09-30 01:56:36	mc_reind33r	The boss room music :)
2015-09-30 01:56:38	harold574	***
2015-09-30 01:56:50	boreh32	@brackleforth theres a what now?
2015-09-30 01:56:59	professoar	Majoras is still my fav, but this is my second fav
2015-09-30 01:57:08	universalgiant	you mean stamina brackle?
2015-09-30 01:57:13	brackleforth	you sprint in skyward sword, with a stamina meter
2015-09-30 01:57:14	brackleforth	ya
2015-09-30 01:57:18	kabii_sama	@Professoar you didn't expect it? :p
2015-09-30 01:57:18	boreh32	oh my god
2015-09-30 01:57:23	boreh32	why
2015-09-30 01:57:26	professoar	no i had no clue it was gonna happen
2015-09-30 01:57:34	professoar	i was like WTF ITS THIS GUY AGAIN
2015-09-30 01:57:52	universalgiant	oh that plot point? i thought you meant a later one
2015-09-30 01:58:00	professoar	there wer a few
2015-09-30 01:58:02	kabii_sama	ok lets not go into too much detail
2015-09-30 01:58:02	dirtyjane	altough the soundtrack is just midi its really diverse and has many nuances to it, nintendo really created a masterpiece in this aspect
2015-09-30 01:58:07	professoar	yeah anyways
2015-09-30 01:58:17	professoar	needless to say i enjoyed the development of the story in this game
2015-09-30 01:58:31	professoar	feels really personal, more then most entries
2015-09-30 01:58:57	brackleforth	personally I like twilight princess but it's not as replayable as oot and ww
2015-09-30 01:59:01	kabii_sama	I like the story up until a point
2015-09-30 01:59:15	kabii_sama	after that point there's not much plot development
2015-09-30 01:59:24	momirstar	ZOMBIE!
2015-09-30 01:59:26	professoar	haha true xD
2015-09-30 01:59:28	universalgiant	i enjoy this game, but i forget quite a bit of it
2015-09-30 01:59:42	vash	TP best zelda imo
2015-09-30 01:59:46	professoar	i forgot the little touching moments liek these
2015-09-30 01:59:49	vash	Best gameplay for sure ;D
2015-09-30 01:59:51	professoar	the music BibleThump
2015-09-30 01:59:52	dirtyjane	sadly yes, most items only get used one time in the corresponding dungeon but for first playthroughs its a wonderful game
2015-09-30 02:00:01	universalgiant	OoT was too much of my childhood not to put it first
2015-09-30 02:00:06	harold574	Make it stop BibleThump
2015-09-30 02:00:15	universalgiant	TP felt like the closest to it gameplay wise
2015-09-30 02:00:19	professoar	feeels BibleThump
2015-09-30 02:00:38	sir_merek	It's a tie between oot, mm and tp for me.
2015-09-30 02:00:47	kabii_sama	tbh a lot of items have more uses than people realize, at least in combat
2015-09-30 02:00:53	harold574	mm was hard af
2015-09-30 02:00:56	dirtyjane	Links Awakening is also great :)
2015-09-30 02:01:01	professoar	i gave up on mm as a kid
2015-09-30 02:01:06	professoar	i didnt beat it till the 3ds remake came out
2015-09-30 02:01:11	professoar	freaking hard ass game
2015-09-30 02:01:12	vash	The only game I ever gave up on as a kid
2015-09-30 02:01:14	professoar	effing stone tower
2015-09-30 02:01:16	kabii_sama	imo the issue with items is more how some later items tend to outclass earlier ones
2015-09-30 02:01:18	vash	was star ocean, till the end of time
2015-09-30 02:01:20	brackleforth	majora's mask is the hardest 3d zelda I think
2015-09-30 02:01:24	universalgiant	i'm kinda glad i didn't experience mm until later. i would have never appreciated it as a kid
2015-09-30 02:01:39	brackleforth	especially the last shooting range was very difficult
2015-09-30 02:01:40	harold574	Aye malon
2015-09-30 02:01:43	professoar	a lot of sadstuff happens in MM o.o
2015-09-30 02:01:45	um_screx	My favorite Zelda game was not Phantom Hourglass
2015-09-30 02:01:46	wowdruid	I remember this area so vividly
2015-09-30 02:01:46	professoar	wich i like
2015-09-30 02:01:46	vash	I recently bought it so ima put that demon to rest ~
2015-09-30 02:01:56	mc_reind33r	Yea i agree majoras mask was tough
2015-09-30 02:01:56	um_screx	The other ones I played were all amazing though
2015-09-30 02:02:04	universalgiant	malo is the best character in this game bar none
2015-09-30 02:02:05	boreh32	awww yea
2015-09-30 02:02:05	professoar	so many people die in MM
2015-09-30 02:02:12	professoar	wich is not common in a zelda game
2015-09-30 02:02:16	kabii_sama	screw Malo
2015-09-30 02:02:25	harold574	im off to school see ya guys, enjoy the game sig :D

2015-09-30 02:03:47	professoar	I really wish they could put mario maker on 3ds

2015-09-30 02:03:54	professoar	yeah King Zora is my bae KappaPride
2015-09-30 02:04:19	kabii_sama	a Wii U port of TP would be better imo
2015-09-30 02:04:26	wowdruid	@Professoar you're my bae bro
2015-09-30 02:04:41	professoar	awww yeah wixMini wixBowsey

2015-09-30 02:04:56	wowdruid	doomsenHotw
2015-09-30 02:04:58	kabii_sama	mailman :D

2015-09-30 02:06:27	wowdruid	PogChamp
2015-09-30 02:06:30	kabii_sama	after WWHD I think people would be pretty peeved if they did another Zelda "remake" on a home console before a new game
2015-09-30 02:06:31	siglemic	picnic
2015-09-30 02:06:32	professoar	PICNIC
2015-09-30 02:06:37	siglemic	should be back

2015-09-30 02:08:02	brackleforth	got the ANT!! your move, ganondorf
2015-09-30 02:08:05	deadeyesx311	yo sig
2015-09-30 02:08:20	andriod3000	SIG PLAYING TP???
2015-09-30 02:08:34	dreamvillerc	What's more better to get MM or Orc
2015-09-30 02:08:50	kabii_sama	dang he just walks right past it lol
2015-09-30 02:09:16	brackleforth	Orc?
2015-09-30 02:09:25	dreamvillerc	Orcarina
2015-09-30 02:09:31	orcastraw	um
2015-09-30 02:09:38	deadeyesx311	orchestra
2015-09-30 02:09:38	orcastraw	ocarina?
2015-09-30 02:09:41	universalgiant	it's personal preference, really
2015-09-30 02:09:43	kabii_sama	I'd say play Orcarina first
2015-09-30 02:09:56	brackleforth	play both, ocarina first
2015-09-30 02:10:02	universalgiant	ocarina is your quintessential zelda game
2015-09-30 02:10:04	professoar	play spirit tracks Kappa
2015-09-30 02:10:07	kabii_sama	you'll enjoy MM more if you have a feel of the N64 Zelda mechanics from OoT
2015-09-30 02:10:07	professoar	its the best one
2015-09-30 02:10:12	universalgiant	majora is more sidestory heavy
2015-09-30 02:10:20	universalgiant	both very solid in their own right
2015-09-30 02:10:29	professoar	majora is also harder and frusterating at times
2015-09-30 02:10:31	dreamvillerc	Damn auto ocarina
2015-09-30 02:10:34	professoar	like more then normal zelda games
2015-09-30 02:10:41	kabii_sama	if you jump right into MM prepare to have a rough time
2015-09-30 02:10:43	dreamvillerc	I LIKE HARD
2015-09-30 02:10:54	dreamvillerc	;)
2015-09-30 02:10:55	universalgiant	NICE
2015-09-30 02:10:56	professoar	its not fun frusterating
2015-09-30 02:10:57	professoar	its like
2015-09-30 02:10:58	universalgiant	first shot
2015-09-30 02:11:08	lizardrice	nice gameshark
2015-09-30 02:11:13	professoar	WHAT THE HELL AM I SUPPOSE TO DO WITH THIS STUPID SHIT AND WHAT TIME TO I HAVE TO BE IN THIS PLACE
2015-09-30 02:11:17	professoar	OH I DONT HAVE THIS MASK YET
2015-09-30 02:11:20	professoar	I JUST WASTED AN HOUR
2015-09-30 02:11:21	samespe4	nice aimbot, hacker
2015-09-30 02:11:24	kabii_sama	also the story is vaguely related between the two so it helps to play OoT first in that regard
2015-09-30 02:11:36	boreh32	i'm so attached to the play through. it's like they're talking to me
2015-09-30 02:12:11	dreamvillerc	Ok will get ocarina and btw what's your thoughts on Zelda u
2015-09-30 02:12:16	turboskerv	Is this a speed run?
2015-09-30 02:12:23	boreh32	first time playing
2015-09-30 02:12:24	professoar	i also like that you can be mobile while your slashing in this game, its oddly satisfying to just be running around and swininging your dinkus everywhere without it stoping you
2015-09-30 02:12:40	mc_reind33r	WHERES DAMPE
2015-09-30 02:12:44	deadeyesx311	sig one more dungeon and then the ending fight
2015-09-30 02:12:53	universalgiant	dampe isn't out during the day ***
2015-09-30 02:12:57	kabii_sama	well it's hard to say how Zelda U will turn out when we know so little
2015-09-30 02:13:15	dreamvillerc	I mean the leaks
2015-09-30 02:13:17	brackleforth	I want to play zelda U so bad
2015-09-30 02:13:25	professoar	zelda u looks sexy
2015-09-30 02:13:27	turboskerv	Love this music
2015-09-30 02:13:33	professoar	it gives me a b0ner, now i have blue balls
2015-09-30 02:13:36	kabii_sama	but if it is and open world non-linear 3D Zelda that'd be pretty sweet
2015-09-30 02:13:43	kabii_sama	*an
2015-09-30 02:13:50	universalgiant	bomb arrows are the best thing ever
2015-09-30 02:14:05	turboskerv	Do you ever talk anymore?
2015-09-30 02:14:14	professoar	sig aint got time for talking
2015-09-30 02:14:19	brackleforth	imagine HD Malon
2015-09-30 02:14:19	professoar	to busy getting bitches and making money
2015-09-30 02:14:33	professoar	mmm HD malon wixBowsey
2015-09-30 02:14:39	turboskerv	Fuck bitches, get rupees
2015-09-30 02:14:42	rotflmaster	Hi
2015-09-30 02:14:43	dreamvillerc	Not to be rude but they've been milking Mario that I don't think any other game has been talked about a lot
2015-09-30 02:15:54	brackleforth	milking mario you say?
2015-09-30 02:15:57	mc_reind33r	Omg I forgot about those fking bugs lol
2015-09-30 02:16:06	kabii_sama	I'd be more interested in a new Wario Land game than a new 2D Mario
2015-09-30 02:16:09	universalgiant	how could you forget?
2015-09-30 02:16:16	universalgiant	the image is engraved into my mind
2015-09-30 02:16:18	kabii_sama	but who know when that'll happen
2015-09-30 02:16:25	mc_reind33r	I spent so much time looking for those haha
2015-09-30 02:16:35	siglemic	i have a sore throat right now so even if i wanted to talk i wouldn't
2015-09-30 02:17:01	siglemic	but no lately i don't do it often.. that might change
2015-09-30 02:17:33	mc_reind33r	It'd be kinda nice for a game like this
2015-09-30 02:17:40	dreamvillerc	Yeah but it seems like the franchise is the only acceptable one to be ok to be milked hard
2015-09-30 02:18:53	brackleforth	mario is like mickey mouse, the head of a huge company
2015-09-30 02:19:01	bluehaze99	Can we talk about the very disappointing new metroid
2015-09-30 02:19:11	kabii_sama	Mario has so many spin-offs at this point that it's understandable if the franchise would have a ton of games being released
2015-09-30 02:19:19	mc_reind33r	That makes me sad
2015-09-30 02:19:34	dreamvillerc	How bad is the new metroid?
2015-09-30 02:19:50	bluehaze99	Go look at the trailer
2015-09-30 02:20:01	kabii_sama	I won't disown the game until I have a chance to actually play it
2015-09-30 02:20:10	brackleforth	you don't play as samus for one thing
2015-09-30 02:20:14	dreamvillerc	What's the full name
2015-09-30 02:20:19	lizardrice	"help you like an item"
2015-09-30 02:20:20	kabii_sama	but yeah I wish we had a new 2D Metroid at this point
2015-09-30 02:20:29	siglemic	i don't want to say i'm shy but i usually just don't feel like talking, lol
2015-09-30 02:20:35	universalgiant	Metroid Prime: The New Game That Everyone Apparently Hates
2015-09-30 02:20:45	bluehaze99	Yeah a 2D platform we would be awesome
2015-09-30 02:20:50	kabii_sama	Metroid Prime: Federation Force
2015-09-30 02:20:53	bluehaze99	A sequel to fusion
2015-09-30 02:21:31	kabii_sama	supposedly it has prime in the name as it'll tie the story of the Prime Trilogy into the next Prime game
2015-09-30 02:22:10	highgamer313	i always watch your stream bro @siglemic
2015-09-30 02:22:15	bluehaze99	We'll see how good that goes not expecting much after other m
2015-09-30 02:22:54	brackleforth	It doesn't look promising, but maybe it will be good. the trailer shows multiplayer gameplay so idk about the campaign
2015-09-30 02:22:57	dreamvillerc	Alright I just saw it looks like a crappy version of halo made by the creators of kidz bop
2015-09-30 02:23:05	mc_reind33r	Fk there goes the smash stage
2015-09-30 02:23:22	kabii_sama	RIP Bridge of Eldin
2015-09-30 02:23:53	bluehaze99	God idk maybe it'll be decent but really there's a damn soccer mini game
2015-09-30 02:23:55	universalgiant	ah good. i've seen people skip killing those guys
2015-09-30 02:25:00	kabii_sama	tbh I wouldn't mind it so much if Federation Force was included as a side game to some standard Metroid game
2015-09-30 02:25:05	snowman	yo siggy
2015-09-30 02:25:11	snowman	how much longer do you think you'll be playing?
2015-09-30 02:25:29	kabii_sama	kinda like how Zelda Four Swords was included with the LttP GBA port
2015-09-30 02:25:48	siglemic	i've been playin like 8 hours
2015-09-30 02:25:53	siglemic	probably till i feel legit fatigued
2015-09-30 02:25:56	brackleforth	they haven't marketed it like that
2015-09-30 02:26:03	snowman	lol alright
2015-09-30 02:26:10	snowman	Imma try falling asleep to the stream then
2015-09-30 02:26:13	snowman	'night, guys
2015-09-30 02:26:18	siglemic	byee
2015-09-30 02:26:29	um_screx	How you feeling so far?
2015-09-30 02:26:39	siglemic	feel ok
2015-09-30 02:26:45	dreamvillerc	It shouldn't be considered a metroid game and it seems like every game now a days there games are games where it has the name of a famous title then it has nothing to do with it
2015-09-30 02:27:04	um_screx	Alright. You sounded pumped back in the goron dungeon.
2015-09-30 02:27:14	bluehaze99	Yeah if it wasnt tied to the story it would be whatever but really that's what they decide to make as a new game when there's so many better ideas
2015-09-30 02:27:28	siglemic	lol pumped?
2015-09-30 02:27:53	um_screx	yeah man
2015-09-30 02:28:14	um_screx	You were all like "This is getting good" and stuff
2015-09-30 02:28:25	siglemic	well it was
2015-09-30 02:28:27	siglemic	the game kinda sucked
2015-09-30 02:28:28	momirstar	I remember him being hungry and leaving the game for 20 minutes
2015-09-30 02:28:33	siglemic	till like.. forest or maybe after
2015-09-30 02:28:39	brackleforth	link can smell the booty now
2015-09-30 02:29:06	bluehaze99	It's like they don't care about how bad the other m sold and how bad that game was in some aspects
2015-09-30 02:29:23	brackleforth	my favorite temple is a ways away, the snow temple
2015-09-30 02:29:25	um_screx	Ok. You sounded pumped though is all I'm saying :P
2015-09-30 02:30:09	bluehaze99	And then there making federation force like that's comeback worthy or something I jut don't get it
2015-09-30 02:30:17	kabii_sama	well the fact that Nintendo itself hasn't worked on a Metroid game for like... over a decade makes it clear how they feel about the series
2015-09-30 02:30:38	bluehaze99	Yeah and it honestly sucks
2015-09-30 02:30:48	bluehaze99	They could do so much more with it
2015-09-30 02:31:13	kabii_sama	if the series is really dead we'll always have romhacks
2015-09-30 02:31:24	bluehaze99	Lol
2015-09-30 02:31:33	kabii_sama	but it seems like Retro at least wants to continue the 3D games eventually
2015-09-30 02:31:39	brackleforth	I think they're working on something else besides federation force
2015-09-30 02:31:47	levelzerotoinfinity	How do you feel about the wolf mechanic so far? I know the consensus is mixed.
2015-09-30 02:33:15	siglemic	its ok
2015-09-30 02:33:28	boreh32	mixed it stays
2015-09-30 02:33:40	levelzerotoinfinity	Yeah haha, that's fair though
2015-09-30 02:34:51	flatbushzombiee	fav zelda game of all time
2015-09-30 02:36:18	um_screx	Alright Sig and chat, I gotta dip. Not because I'm tired or anything, but rather because my battery is 4%.
2015-09-30 02:36:28	belugatron	It's nice that people leave their doors open for dog link
2015-09-30 02:36:35	um_screx	fun hangin with you guys
2015-09-30 02:36:36	mc_reind33r	Bye
2015-09-30 02:36:37	flatbushzombiee	wolf link*** ***
2015-09-30 02:36:47	belugatron	same thing
2015-09-30 02:37:16	flatbushzombiee	cats, lions, same thing Kappa
2015-09-30 02:37:20	brackleforth	wolf link makes you feel locked into the story
2015-09-30 02:37:23	belugatron	correct
2015-09-30 02:37:32	bluehaze99	Another 2D platformer that was a sequel to fusion and included the X again would be great but Nintendo won't do that for some reason
2015-09-30 02:37:36	belugatron	small cat, big cat. whatever
2015-09-30 02:37:58	belugatron	Nintendo has some weirdd anti metroid grudge
2015-09-30 02:38:24	brackleforth	we need a new way to revive ridley
2015-09-30 02:38:33	flatbushzombiee	is sig going to big house?
2015-09-30 02:38:50	belugatron	Giving him robot body parts has been working pretty well
2015-09-30 02:39:21	belugatron	that happened at least 3 times
2015-09-30 02:39:27	brackleforth	he can be part zombie, part robot, part mushroom parasite, part genetic enhancements, part clone
2015-09-30 02:39:41	bluehaze99	I know and it's not like metroid did bad as a series it's just as iconic as Mario or Zelda
2015-09-30 02:39:48	bluehaze99	Lol
2015-09-30 02:39:54	flatbushzombiee	idk
2015-09-30 02:40:07	flatbushzombiee	mario is like above and beyond all other franchises
2015-09-30 02:40:27	belugatron	I feel like pokwmon makes close to mario amounts of money
2015-09-30 02:40:29	mc_reind33r	I'm surprised nobody has said anything about starfox
2015-09-30 02:40:45	belugatron	well there's a new starfox coming out
2015-09-30 02:40:58	belugatron	and it isn't called starfox federation force
2015-09-30 02:41:02	flatbushzombiee	i'm ready for pokemon beta thing
2015-09-30 02:41:05	formula91	lmao
2015-09-30 02:41:07	belugatron	so it'll probably be a real game
2015-09-30 02:41:08	flatbushzombiee	pick up bitches Kappa
2015-09-30 02:41:11	boreh32	it's like nintendo forgets what makes their ip's popular in the first place
2015-09-30 02:41:12	mc_reind33r	Lol
2015-09-30 02:41:25	trombonegamer	oh...
2015-09-30 02:41:32	boreh32	noooo
2015-09-30 02:41:54	brackleforth	the new starfox looks like it needs polish before release
2015-09-30 02:42:03	alexuiui	LOL get rekkt son #420mlgswag
2015-09-30 02:42:08	hamcheese24	hey siglemic :D
2015-09-30 02:42:12	brackleforth	textures were pretty bland
2015-09-30 02:42:16	flatbushzombiee	PogChamp
2015-09-30 02:42:43	belugatron	It'll probably play well since platinum's making it
2015-09-30 02:42:54	trombonegamer	Well the new star fox looks the way it does because it has to be rendered twice
2015-09-30 02:43:21	trombonegamer	It's pretty hard on an already weak CPU
2015-09-30 02:43:31	sw4j	I really don't get what people are going on about with regards to Star Fox Zero. It doesn't look amazing, but it looks pretty damn good
2015-09-30 02:43:58	bluehaze99	What the starfox game on GameCube called again?
2015-09-30 02:44:05	brackleforth	assault
2015-09-30 02:44:05	flatbushzombiee	assaul
2015-09-30 02:44:26	flatbushzombiee	custom robo reboot nintendo pls
2015-09-30 02:44:29	bluehaze99	With that little dinosaur right?
2015-09-30 02:44:37	brackleforth	gc starfox had great space fights but not enough of them
2015-09-30 02:44:45	belugatron	Adventures Kappa
2015-09-30 02:44:48	sw4j	The one with the dino was Starfox Adventures
2015-09-30 02:44:54	bluehaze99	Oh
2015-09-30 02:44:58	sw4j	the bastardized game was Assault
2015-09-30 02:45:10	belugatron	Assault was aight
2015-09-30 02:45:52	bluehaze99	It used to play starfox adventures so much as a kid I never finished it lol
2015-09-30 02:46:06	fnaticyeiiowstar	RIGHT IN THE KOKORO

2015-09-30 02:48:38	belugatron	Can you still get stuck in an inescapable room that autosaves in this game?
2015-09-30 02:48:45	mc_reind33r	I honestly don't remember what to do here lol

2015-09-30 19:03:09	thefearen	this is probably the worst part of the game though.
2015-09-30 19:03:09	checkout10	But i'll try medium
2015-09-30 19:03:10	tmr69	refresh/restart your net?
2015-09-30 19:03:20	tcs757	This game gets way more shit than it deserves.
2015-09-30 19:03:25	tmr69	mine is like 60mb and i'm watching this on source
2015-09-30 19:03:27	tracedout	the lake hylia tears are the most boring part
2015-09-30 19:03:33	tracedout	i liked the kakiriko tears though
2015-09-30 19:03:44	siglemic	for a lot of isps there's a max # of open connections you can have.. so if you're torrenting or watching many streams you'll get fucked either way
2015-09-30 19:03:53	thefearen	@Tcs757 Its easily my favorite.
2015-09-30 19:03:57	torgon1	same
2015-09-30 19:04:04	kingstonbeer	sig how can u tell?
2015-09-30 19:04:25	torgon1	its like oot and majora's mask fised togheter
2015-09-30 19:04:28	siglemic	where do you go
2015-09-30 19:04:29	tcs757	Yeah, I love this game, the only wolf parts that are annoying is some of the tears.
2015-09-30 19:04:33	siglemic	this part makes me want to die
2015-09-30 19:04:44	tracedout	theres a tear around hyrule castle
2015-09-30 19:04:45	torgon1	fused*
2015-09-30 19:04:46	thefearen	did you get the ones in the water yet?
2015-09-30 19:04:52	mc_reind33r	Back to the lake I think
2015-09-30 19:05:01	keeiesh	up the river I think
2015-09-30 19:05:14	rendood	lake I think, and there's the one where you hitchhike one of the birds
2015-09-30 19:05:17	rendood	the ones*
2015-09-30 19:05:17	tracedout	most of them are around the lake though
2015-09-30 19:05:34	feiqn	lanayru twilight makes everyone want to die
2015-09-30 19:05:38	rendood	this part is pretty dumb
2015-09-30 19:05:40	feiqn	go back to the lake and blow on bird grass
2015-09-30 19:05:50	tracedout	he got the bird bugs
2015-09-30 19:05:52	siglemic	i was trying to find a way to jump back down
2015-09-30 19:06:03	thefearen	can't you check the map to see where they are?
2015-09-30 19:06:05	rendood	oh he got the bird ones
2015-09-30 19:06:08	rendood	cool
2015-09-30 19:06:21	feiqn	he needs to go to upper zora's domain though
2015-09-30 19:06:35	feiqn	so go back to the bird
2015-09-30 19:06:41	feiqn	I run this game, you need the bird. ***
2015-09-30 19:06:41	rendood	true
2015-09-30 19:07:15	sistakaren	warp to upper zora's domain?
2015-09-30 19:07:20	feiqn	down to the lake on the left side of the map siggy
2015-09-30 19:07:38	feiqn	oh yeah i guess you would have that warp by now
2015-09-30 19:07:42	siglemic	i forgot warping was a thing
2015-09-30 19:08:22	checkout10	Checked reddit, since the upgrade a lot of people are having buffering issues on twitch
2015-09-30 19:10:17	caneut	im fine
2015-09-30 19:10:30	feiqn	gotta go back up
2015-09-30 19:10:33	feiqn	there's a midna jump
2015-09-30 19:13:58	feiqn	go bak to the lack now
2015-09-30 19:14:05	feiqn	the last one will appear when you kill the one that's there
2015-09-30 19:14:16	feiqn	also if you want me to stop backseating lemme know
2015-09-30 19:14:35	mc_reind33r	Come on bruh don't tell him everything man
2015-09-30 19:14:36	r176	Ahoy! What's goin on today
2015-09-30 19:14:44	feiqn	well he said he was sick of this part
2015-09-30 19:14:59	r176	Is he playing casually?
2015-09-30 19:15:05	feiqn	no this is a speedrun
2015-09-30 19:15:06	thefearen	yeah
2015-09-30 19:15:15	r176	Hm
2015-09-30 19:15:19	feiqn	all this other stuff is RNG manip
2015-09-30 19:15:28	dalmakhani	gamcube version?
2015-09-30 19:15:33	feiqn	dreamcast
2015-09-30 19:15:40	kabii_sama	look at the HUD
2015-09-30 19:15:48	dalmakhani	yea i see now
2015-09-30 19:17:26	boreh32	sexy
2015-09-30 19:18:29	eggy2125	omg fav zelda game
2015-09-30 19:18:48	brookxiii	dont die to the giant insect now lol
2015-09-30 19:18:52	eggy2125	are you playing on GC or Wii?
2015-09-30 19:19:03	thefearen	hold b
2015-09-30 19:19:20	nodzz	man, classic let's play IQ drop ***
2015-09-30 19:19:31	thefearen	i know right
2015-09-30 19:19:49	rendood	yay, tears over \o/ back to an actual videogame
2015-09-30 19:20:21	caneut	that one bug had one tear
2015-09-30 19:20:23	caneut	bullshit
2015-09-30 19:20:25	dalmakhani	what version was better? i only played gamecube one. was wii controls good?
2015-09-30 19:20:26	thefearen	tears are just a right of passage.
2015-09-30 19:20:34	brookxiii	i think hunting down the bugs was the thing i disliked most about this game
2015-09-30 19:20:40	eggy2125	wii controls got annoying
2015-09-30 19:20:45	radicllarry	wolf sections are the worst part of this game
2015-09-30 19:21:13	eggy2125	having to wave your arm about every time you needed to attack got old quickly
2015-09-30 19:23:28	brookxiii	i think ill always prefer a controller over motion controls , except for mario kart
2015-09-30 19:23:34	s4mch4m	damn it's been awhile since i've seen this game
2015-09-30 19:23:41	eggy2125	i don't remember this bit at all
2015-09-30 19:23:56	floraline	whats wrong with link
2015-09-30 19:24:01	kabii_sama	this cutscene ***
2015-09-30 19:24:07	radicllarry	quality bioware writing
2015-09-30 19:24:19	siglemic	wtf @ this cutscene lol
2015-09-30 19:24:24	brookxiii	oh yea this nightmare of a cutscene lmao
2015-09-30 19:24:25	dalmakhani	***
2015-09-30 19:24:31	radicllarry	they were definitely stoned
2015-09-30 19:24:31	brookxiii	so bizarre
2015-09-30 19:24:34	thefearen	legit scared me as a kid
2015-09-30 19:24:35	s4mch4m	lmao that face
2015-09-30 19:24:45	eggy2125	what is the darkest (in terms of themes and writing) zelda game?
2015-09-30 19:24:48	kabii_sama	it's backstory but the way they visualized it is weird
2015-09-30 19:24:48	boreh32	these faces
2015-09-30 19:24:57	eggy2125	Twilight Princess, OoT or Majora's?
2015-09-30 19:24:57	cptb0b	this one prolly
2015-09-30 19:24:58	s4mch4m	majora imo
2015-09-30 19:25:02	thefearen	@Eggy2125 this one
2015-09-30 19:25:04	kabii_sama	Majora for sure
2015-09-30 19:25:05	rendood	Majora is super dark
2015-09-30 19:25:06	tracedout	majora is the most existential
2015-09-30 19:25:25	s4mch4m	i loved majoa for all of its little secrets
2015-09-30 19:25:26	eggy2125	majora kinda feels like it doesn't matter tho
2015-09-30 19:25:27	tracedout	its not necessarily dark but there's a sadness that permeates everything because everyone is coping with death
2015-09-30 19:25:40	rendood	everyone is either dying or about to die
2015-09-30 19:25:40	eggy2125	it's off on a different planet and everyone's already accepted death
2015-09-30 19:25:55	thefearen	Majora's is more depressing than dark
2015-09-30 19:25:57	kabii_sama	not really
2015-09-30 19:26:12	s4mch4m	this music is so nice
2015-09-30 19:26:17	kabii_sama	have you seen the swordsman guy on day 3? clearly that dude doesn't wanna die
2015-09-30 19:26:19	s4mch4m	tp is my fav soundtrack
2015-09-30 19:26:35	eggy2125	to be fair, TP is the only Zelda i've played all that much of
2015-09-30 19:26:35	rendood	this music is great. I love the overworld in this game, especially exploring with epona
2015-09-30 19:26:55	nodzz	it might be nostalgia but oot was best for me in terms of music
2015-09-30 19:27:00	nodzz	but they were all good so :D
2015-09-30 19:27:03	kabii_sama	the way various NPCs react towards the moon falling in MM is one of the nice aspects of the game
2015-09-30 19:27:03	s4mch4m	want a tp remaster even though i don't have a wii u lol
2015-09-30 19:27:14	eggy2125	tp remaster
2015-09-30 19:27:20	eggy2125	it still looks good tho
2015-09-30 19:27:22	froggiemo	Wind Waker HD remaster pls
2015-09-30 19:27:29	caneut	ww sucks
2015-09-30 19:27:32	s4mch4m	it can look wayy better though
2015-09-30 19:27:33	thefearen	wind waker hd hd
2015-09-30 19:27:45	froggiemo	I loved everything about wind waker
2015-09-30 19:28:01	boreh32	tingle?
2015-09-30 19:28:10	froggiemo	Especially that. Kappa
2015-09-30 19:28:13	eggy2125	the cel shaded graphics?
2015-09-30 19:28:13	boreh32	the price gouging bastard
2015-09-30 19:28:35	froggiemo	The cel shaded gave it that unique look imo
2015-09-30 19:28:39	floraline	this game is so weird
2015-09-30 19:28:48	froggiemo	I love when games don't take themselves too seriously
2015-09-30 19:28:50	thefearen	but i love it
2015-09-30 19:28:55	eggy2125	i was never a fan of the kiddie zelda stuff
2015-09-30 19:29:02	tmr69	twilight gone Kreygasm
2015-09-30 19:29:16	froggiemo	I hate the new 3DS zeldas tho
2015-09-30 19:29:21	mc_reind33r	I feel like wind water was a game everybody disliked at first but once it grew on ppl they appreciated it
2015-09-30 19:29:22	feiqn	oh right I forgot this part existed
2015-09-30 19:29:30	eggy2125	i dunno, my favourite game is braid so i guess i love games that take themselves way too seriously
2015-09-30 19:29:36	radicllarry	WW did nothing with it's art style, every fucking dungeon was gray stoen and grass
2015-09-30 19:29:40	radicllarry	or just grass or just stone
2015-09-30 19:29:48	radicllarry	and overworld was ass
2015-09-30 19:30:11	froggiemo	I'm a simple man
2015-09-30 19:30:13	eggy2125	attack the Cuccos Kappa
2015-09-30 19:30:15	radicllarry	sailing was cool for liek 5 minutes and then got tedious
2015-09-30 19:30:19	kabii_sama	how was the volcano gray stone and grass
2015-09-30 19:30:23	froggiemo	I don't need much, the music was enough to set that atmosphere for me
2015-09-30 19:30:43	mc_reind33r	WW had one of the largest overworlds tho
2015-09-30 19:30:45	froggiemo	That first time you go on Dragon Roost Island.. oh baby
2015-09-30 19:30:46	radicllarry	there was the volcano and the forest dungeon everything else was generic and boring
2015-09-30 19:31:02	siglemic	brb
2015-09-30 19:31:03	radicllarry	large isnt always good MC_REiNd33r especially when its all water
2015-09-30 19:31:04	siglemic	for a few
2015-09-30 19:31:19	tcs757	It isn't ALL water though, that's the point
2015-09-30 19:31:24	tcs757	There are tons of little things to exlpore
2015-09-30 19:31:39	tcs757	Whether it's the shitty treasures, the sea monsters or the small uncharted islands with things to do on em
2015-09-30 19:31:51	mc_reind33r	Yea. These was something on almost every island
2015-09-30 19:31:52	tracedout	there are a bunch of cool islands
2015-09-30 19:31:54	tcs757	And that's coming from someone who doesn't like WW that much
2015-09-30 19:32:01	froggiemo	I loved exploring the different isles, the different moons, the ghost ships, the tentacruels, there was a lot to do
2015-09-30 19:32:06	boreh32	left us looking at this guy
2015-09-30 19:32:13	tracedout	this guy owns
2015-09-30 19:32:30	kabii_sama	if you get over the fact that there was too much space between islands (dunno if it was realism or what) there's a lot of stuff to explore in WW
2015-09-30 19:32:32	tcs757	WW is a fine game, there's really not much you can say bad about it whether you like it or not.
2015-09-30 19:32:50	radicllarry	Im not saying WW is bad
2015-09-30 19:32:51	tmr69	the movement is pretty bad compared to n64 zeldas
2015-09-30 19:32:53	tracedout	i really hated setting the wind in WW
2015-09-30 19:32:53	froggiemo	Gotta say I'm biased tho as it is my favorite game of all time so yeah haha
2015-09-30 19:32:55	radicllarry	but there arent really any worse 3D zeldas
2015-09-30 19:32:59	radicllarry	except maybe skyward sword
2015-09-30 19:33:00	tracedout	so when i had to readjust and sail against the wind
2015-09-30 19:33:06	tracedout	i'd just coast for 5 minutes
2015-09-30 19:33:11	froggiemo	Skyward was too casual for me.. I think
2015-09-30 19:33:12	tracedout	stubbornly not setting the wind
2015-09-30 19:33:13	froggiemo	It felt off
2015-09-30 19:33:30	kabii_sama	not just optional islands, but platforms and subs had secrets on them in the Great Sea
2015-09-30 19:33:31	tcs757	Skyward felt... Linear?
2015-09-30 19:33:36	radicllarry	alright so say skyward sword is worse than WW
2015-09-30 19:33:37	tracedout	skyward had no world
2015-09-30 19:33:40	radicllarry	any otehr 3D zeldas?
2015-09-30 19:33:40	froggiemo	The story was odd too, the dungeon were great and all but eh
2015-09-30 19:33:40	mc_reind33r	I agree with you skyward sword was bad but WW is in a whole different category I think
2015-09-30 19:34:00	froggiemo	Plus you don't get the Hylian shield for a while which was a big turn off for me somehow
2015-09-30 19:34:00	brookxiii	i never finished skyward sword :/
2015-09-30 19:34:04	tcs757	In the grand scheme of things we haven't had a TON of 3d zeldas
2015-09-30 19:34:11	boreh32	i never played it
2015-09-30 19:34:17	brookxiii	i kept losing interest midway through
2015-09-30 19:34:19	tracedout	ss had an amazing middle and bad beginning end and extras
2015-09-30 19:34:21	rendood	SS's pacing is like... you're driving a beautiful car in a long beautiful road that has one speed bump every car length
2015-09-30 19:34:21	froggiemo	I never played MM. Don't stone me pls.
2015-09-30 19:34:21	tmr69	silent realms were some spooky shit
2015-09-30 19:34:34	tmr69	emulate it froggie
2015-09-30 19:34:49	brookxiii	mm is worth playing froggie
2015-09-30 19:34:51	siglemic	makin' coffee and bagel
2015-09-30 19:35:03	boreh32	good stuff
2015-09-30 19:35:04	froggiemo	MM is just so weird.. I hate being pushed to do stuff
2015-09-30 19:35:12	kabii_sama	aside from OoT and MM the 3D Zeldas were intentionally made to be very distinct from one another
2015-09-30 19:35:16	rendood	it's hard to enjoy certain parts of it when they clearly shove so many things down your throat
2015-09-30 19:35:16	boreh32	so much coffee
2015-09-30 19:35:18	froggiemo	The time constraint is what turns me off the most
2015-09-30 19:35:23	rottking	everything bagels are the best, cinnamon raisin close second
2015-09-30 19:35:25	siglemic	i didn't actually end up making any at the start
2015-09-30 19:35:25	kingdededee	@Siglemic do you ever play mario 64 off stream for fun? Or do you find the game not as satisfying right now? I enjoy watching you play other games :)
2015-09-30 19:35:30	kabii_sama	it's unlikely anyone will enjoy every 3D Zelda equally
2015-09-30 19:35:32	brookxiii	but you can slow it down to where time constraint isnt an issue at all
2015-09-30 19:35:39	siglemic	but it's true that i am an addict
2015-09-30 19:35:45	boreh32	that first cup Kreygasm
2015-09-30 19:35:47	nodzz	Froggiemo, including what Brook said, you can always start again on top of that
2015-09-30 19:35:58	tmr69	do you have coffee at tournies?
2015-09-30 19:36:02	brookxiii	i dont like coffee
2015-09-30 19:36:04	brookxiii	so bitter
2015-09-30 19:36:07	nodzz	and with the slowdown, you normally get given quit a bit of time
2015-09-30 19:36:08	tmr69	cause i wouldn't, i would be afraid my heart would explode
2015-09-30 19:36:17	siglemic	you get used to it
2015-09-30 19:36:18	nodzz	Coffee is hot bitter mud imo :P
2015-09-30 19:36:23	caneut	add milk and suger brook,...
2015-09-30 19:36:23	boreh32	blasphemy
2015-09-30 19:36:23	brookxiii	i like cappuccinos and stuff tho, all that sugar haha
2015-09-30 19:36:40	brookxiii	caneut i need to add so much that its not even coffee anymore
2015-09-30 19:36:40	froggiemo	I'll try it some day, are the ROMs any good? I've had bad experiences with certain N64 roms
2015-09-30 19:36:41	siglemic	no TMR
2015-09-30 19:36:51	caneut	wait till your older
2015-09-30 19:36:54	froggiemo	I wish I could get a copy to play on my n64 tho
2015-09-30 19:37:07	kabii_sama	I can see why the time management aspect of MM would turn some people off but personally I just felt it added to the challenge
2015-09-30 19:37:09	brookxiii	idk that my taste is gonna change much anymore
2015-09-30 19:37:14	siglemic	i think i do play better w/ caffeine when i'm not nervous, but it makes me nervous easier
2015-09-30 19:37:18	tmr69	google emuparadise and get roms from there
2015-09-30 19:37:19	brookxiii	im not that young
2015-09-30 19:37:23	tmr69	@ froggie
2015-09-30 19:37:42	kabii_sama	also the story in MM wouldn't have had such an impact if you could spend forever saving the world from the moon
2015-09-30 19:37:46	tmr69	yea that makes sense
2015-09-30 19:38:07	mc_reind33r	Dang I gotta go to class. Alright later guys
2015-09-30 19:38:16	brookxiii	bye mc
2015-09-30 19:38:19	boreh32	have fun at school
2015-09-30 19:38:26	froggiemo	That's right Kabii, but I dislike being timed in games.. I love exploring at my own pace and not feel pushed, not saying MM is bad or anything
2015-09-30 19:38:30	tmr69	my body is weird during tourney sets, i don't get nervous about losing straight up but my hands start shaking and heart rate goes super high
2015-09-30 19:38:33	tmr69	it's weird
2015-09-30 19:38:35	froggiemo	I've watched Chugga's LP and it looked very good
2015-09-30 19:38:48	siglemic	ya that only happens to me when i drink caffeine tmr
2015-09-30 19:38:52	kabii_sama	yeah that's perfectly fine if it's your preference
2015-09-30 19:39:01	kabii_sama	everyone has different tastes
2015-09-30 19:39:08	siglemic	if i just spam water i play like normal
2015-09-30 19:39:18	tracedout	thats adrenaline probably
2015-09-30 19:39:18	tmr69	spam water lool
2015-09-30 19:39:20	froggiemo	Besides I've never played it my opinion isn't very strong :P
2015-09-30 19:39:32	tmr69	yeah trace, but it also feels incredible afterwards so i kinda like it
2015-09-30 19:39:33	boreh32	hydration is key
2015-09-30 19:39:58	froggiemo	The only thing I did in MM was walking around in the town with the chicken mask I think.. I remember being followed by chickens? lol
2015-09-30 19:40:11	froggiemo	Must've been 10 years ago
2015-09-30 19:40:19	tracedout	i was really young when i went to ssbm tournies so i always got nervous and choked during matches
2015-09-30 19:40:34	tmr69	the cool thing about mm is that the timer (imo) is basically just a way of choosing what you want to do in a time period
2015-09-30 19:40:45	siglemic	everyone does, happens less w/ experience
2015-09-30 19:40:48	twitchnotify	daham1 subscribed for 5 months in a row!
2015-09-30 19:40:54	tcs757	The timer changes so much though, everyone in the game has their own little schedule
2015-09-30 19:40:56	tmr69	so if you want to do side shit you got 3 days to do it then do something else after you reset
2015-09-30 19:40:57	siglemic	thank you daham ~_^
2015-09-30 19:41:00	boreh32	sub hype
2015-09-30 19:41:02	tcs757	And that's really fucking cool for the time period
2015-09-30 19:41:07	daham1	np <3
2015-09-30 19:41:10	rendood	sub!
2015-09-30 19:41:13	kabii_sama	imo every Zelda (except maybe the first two) is worth playing through at some point... not to say you should play them all 100% and enjoy every moment of it, but each game has it's pros and cons
2015-09-30 19:41:20	froggiemo	Yeah that sounds cool
2015-09-30 19:41:23	rendood	agreed kabii
2015-09-30 19:41:39	froggiemo	The only zeldas I haven't played are MM and the multiple gameboy color/advance ones
2015-09-30 19:41:48	tcs757	So like, certain side quests can't be done all in one cycle because you're focused on someone else's schedule and working around that.
2015-09-30 19:41:59	tracedout	even when i had a lot of experience i choked. i think i just cared too much
2015-09-30 19:42:02	kabii_sama	the Oracle games are really good imo
2015-09-30 19:42:12	tracedout	when i got good at pc games and went to lans i didnt really care and played amazing
2015-09-30 19:42:17	brookxiii	the only handheld zelda ive played is minish cap
2015-09-30 19:42:24	kabii_sama	definately worth playing and doing a linked game for the second one
2015-09-30 19:42:27	froggiemo	I tried them on emulator but they weren't my jam
2015-09-30 19:42:45	tcs757	Link's Awakening is apparently really good, albeit very strange
2015-09-30 19:43:00	tracedout	speaking of twin peaks, links awakening was inspired by that
2015-09-30 19:43:03	siglemic	mm is my favorite
2015-09-30 19:43:07	kabii_sama	yeah it has a ton of Mario cameos
2015-09-30 19:43:11	siglemic	you shoudl play that if u havent
2015-09-30 19:43:32	kabii_sama	like Wart from SMB2 (US) shows up in Link's Awakening for some reason
2015-09-30 19:43:40	froggiemo	I was born with OoT so I got used to 3D zeldas and never really liked the top viewed zeldas
2015-09-30 19:44:15	froggiemo	Except Phantom Hourglass and the Choo Choo one hehe those were decent
2015-09-30 19:44:20	tmr69	sig do you know of a good/near perfect flowchart for cging spacies as fox on fd? i have the general idea of utilting certain DIs for pre-50% cg, then from there i see leffen do multiple utilts/wd utilt then bair or whatever, but idk much other than that
2015-09-30 19:44:34	tmr69	i ban fd vs spacies because the cg is just a pain to do
2015-09-30 19:44:46	tmr69	but i don't want to have any weak stages
2015-09-30 19:45:51	ilovelampxx	Sorry but what's happening right now
2015-09-30 19:45:59	kabii_sama	break time
2015-09-30 19:46:02	ilovelampxx	Ahh
2015-09-30 19:46:04	rendood	speaking of stages I just bought mario maker <3 really looking forward to it
2015-09-30 19:46:04	ilovelampxx	kk
2015-09-30 19:46:08	tmr69	coffee and bagel is happening
2015-09-30 19:46:18	siglemic	yes tmr
2015-09-30 19:46:37	banjokaz00ie	how do u rank TP among the zeldas sig
2015-09-30 19:46:41	siglemic	0-20%, either uthrow usmash or just uthrow chaingrab if you're very confident
2015-09-30 19:46:41	tmr69	sick, can i take a look?
2015-09-30 19:46:45	froggiemo	Screw it, I'm downloading majora's mask you guys tempted me.
2015-09-30 19:47:02	siglemic	straight up regrabs until 50%, then u start utilting neutral/slight DI and regrabbing full
2015-09-30 19:47:40	caneut	ssb64 > melee
2015-09-30 19:47:42	rendood	nice Froggie
2015-09-30 19:47:44	siglemic	it starts to get a little messy around 70-90% because utilt no longer works on slight DI
2015-09-30 19:47:45	rendood	have fun
2015-09-30 19:47:46	randy_manhammer	dont forget to save as soon as you get to the room with the canon and quit the game!
2015-09-30 19:47:56	randy_manhammer	Kappa
2015-09-30 19:48:23	tmr69	guess i could usmash/nair or something
2015-09-30 19:48:35	siglemic	so for slight DI at those %s u have to either nair/bair techchase (or edgeguard if theyre off stage), light uair regrab, or light bair regrab
2015-09-30 19:48:36	tmr69	or dd regrab uthrow uair if they don't react to the uthrow
2015-09-30 19:48:38	daftnub	best stream, ever.
2015-09-30 19:48:50	froggiemo	@Randy Is that something I'll get later? :P
2015-09-30 19:48:57	tmr69	alright cool
2015-09-30 19:49:03	tmr69	thanks man, need to grind this shit out
2015-09-30 19:49:08	daftnub	his eyes burn my soul
2015-09-30 19:49:59	siglemic	at 90%+, you uair at neutral DI, usmash full DI, and the previous things i said for slight
2015-09-30 19:50:52	tompolek	hi siglemic
2015-09-30 19:50:56	tmr69	alright
2015-09-30 19:51:13	1eamannan	loz tp Kreygasm <3
2015-09-30 19:51:25	tmr69	just hate getting cg'd on fd and not being able to do it back to players i win sets vs anyway
2015-09-30 19:51:32	tmr69	lol
2015-09-30 19:51:33	siglemic	but i think most of the time, i prefer just hard nair or bair techchase or edgeguard at those midhigh %s
2015-09-30 19:51:54	carbon0xide	is this a casual run DansGame
2015-09-30 19:52:07	tmr69	i always see leffen do like
2015-09-30 19:52:19	tmr69	2-3 utilts in a row at like 50%, then bair or whatever
2015-09-30 19:52:21	siglemic	i think at 90%+, uthrow, slight DI light bair usmash is a kill setup
2015-09-30 19:52:43	tmr69	lool that's pretty creative
2015-09-30 19:52:47	siglemic	yeah you can utilt wavedash utilt but if they full DI away you have to react in time and regrab
2015-09-30 19:53:38	tmr69	oh
2015-09-30 19:53:48	tmr69	that doesn't sound too bad, my reactions are ok
2015-09-30 19:54:05	muschelsalat	did he fall asleep or just afk?
2015-09-30 19:54:25	siglemic	leffen's flowchart is pretty good, you could just follow that
2015-09-30 19:54:28	rendood	he's eating/taking a break
2015-09-30 19:54:47	tmr69	it looks significantly easier, leffen's chart
2015-09-30 19:54:57	tmr69	but the proper cg sounds optimal so i'll learn both anyway
2015-09-30 19:55:20	tmr69	thanks again
2015-09-30 19:55:22	siglemic	yea just start pummeling
2015-09-30 19:55:28	siglemic	when ppl dont pummel it hurts my soul
2015-09-30 19:55:37	tmr69	lool
2015-09-30 19:55:45	radicllarry	are you going to big house 5
2015-09-30 19:55:58	siglemic	1 at 20 and 2 at.. 60? i do 2 earlier tho
2015-09-30 19:56:30	tracedout	pummeling always made me laugh because when i played everyone assumed you werent gonna really punish them being lazy mashers
2015-09-30 19:56:40	tracedout	then you throw in an extra one and they go nuts
2015-09-30 19:56:43	tracedout	with the mashing
2015-09-30 19:56:52	randy_manhammer	***
2015-09-30 19:57:27	vertov64	um. what is this? lol
2015-09-30 19:57:31	ilikecyan	Kappa
2015-09-30 19:57:35	vertov64	just came to stream
2015-09-30 19:57:38	trueround	AHHH MEMORIES
2015-09-30 19:57:39	vertov64	to see sig looking at.....
2015-09-30 19:57:41	vertov64	diamonds
2015-09-30 19:57:45	siglemic	if it's one of those guys who's controller is completely silent whenever u grab them
2015-09-30 19:57:56	randy_manhammer	the diamonds are part of the TAS
2015-09-30 19:58:02	siglemic	always throw in an extra one until they start doing it
2015-09-30 19:58:03	siglemic	lol
2015-09-30 19:58:47	tmr69	haha
2015-09-30 19:59:18	tmr69	i always get like 2-3 pummels if i can cause no one bothers mashing out of it except for like top 10 players in my region
2015-09-30 19:59:54	naw397	Hello
2015-09-30 19:59:57	tmr69	tp sound effects are really good for the moving and everything
2015-09-30 20:00:07	radicllarry	being a captain falcon main is suffering
2015-09-30 20:00:25	romeo____	Hi Siglemic :)
2015-09-30 20:00:25	tmr69	pp thinks falcon is a top 5 character potentially
2015-09-30 20:00:30	radicllarry	im so bad at short hop -> up air edgeguard
2015-09-30 20:01:03	tmr69	falcon only really loses sets to like... falco/sheik, maybe fox? but it's not that bad since 20GX stuff is easier on him than falco
2015-09-30 20:01:15	siglemic	i h8 when ppl complain about falcon. he has the best dash in the game >___>
2015-09-30 20:01:49	tracedout	being really good at falcon didnt seem as fun as being bad at him and running around
2015-09-30 20:01:59	tmr69	he also has amazing edgeguard tools, easy knee setups, one of the best neutral pokes in the game, a grab that combos basically every single character except fastfallers which you techchase
2015-09-30 20:02:12	tmr69	really fast platform movement, etc
2015-09-30 20:02:27	siglemic	lol
2015-09-30 20:02:29	siglemic	rip
2015-09-30 20:02:39	tmr69	gg
2015-09-30 20:02:39	kabii_sama	haha
2015-09-30 20:02:41	rendood	damn
2015-09-30 20:03:04	kabii_sama	good thing there's no death counter in this one :p
2015-09-30 20:05:09	radicllarry	Not saying falcon is bad I just find his advanced shit hard to do consistently
2015-09-30 20:05:23	radicllarry	although I dont have much experience with other characters so as far as I know hes easy
2015-09-30 20:06:39	radicllarry	its funny how much easier execution is in street fighter over smash
2015-09-30 20:07:04	radicllarry	tilts are the weirdest shit ever
2015-09-30 20:07:15	poplzerz	Is Cosmo gonna talk or not ?
2015-09-30 20:07:27	rendood	he probably talks
2015-09-30 20:07:30	rendood	in his channel
2015-09-30 20:08:36	poplzerz	Oh
2015-09-30 20:08:38	poplzerz	Yea
2015-09-30 20:08:42	rottking	would you guys let midna put it in your butt
2015-09-30 20:08:49	poplzerz	He talks as he watches it
2015-09-30 20:09:00	randy_manhammer	more like hydrool xd!
2015-09-30 20:09:03	brodin1337	>This is enjoyable
2015-09-30 20:09:07	poplzerz	Midna has a giant fist
2015-09-30 20:09:07	brodin1337	Kepe it up
2015-09-30 20:09:19	poplzerz	I don't think I can fit a fist that big
2015-09-30 20:09:22	jholdenbvb09	siglemic do you like beef jerky
2015-09-30 20:09:25	poplzerz	In my butt
2015-09-30 20:09:29	naw397	You mean fist my butt with her big orange hand?
2015-09-30 20:09:35	randy_manhammer	siglemic what kind of beef jerky do you like?
2015-09-30 20:09:36	poplzerz	^^
2015-09-30 20:09:54	siglemic	peppered beef jerky owns
2015-09-30 20:10:18	naw397	Don't worry it's a ghost hand, it doesn't count. It isn't weird

2015-09-30 20:11:55	tmr69	kool
2015-09-30 20:12:18	naw397	See this is fuzzy too it isn't just the twilight parts
2015-09-30 20:12:31	naw397	The whole game is fuzzy
2015-09-30 20:12:33	fsbr_crush	not sure how i feel about this game
2015-09-30 20:12:36	fsbr_crush	havent played it since 07
2015-09-30 20:12:55	siglemic	seems to be good so far
2015-09-30 20:13:00	sackjavone	Not a fan of twilight princess
2015-09-30 20:13:12	fsbr_crush	i judge games solely based on their aesthetic
2015-09-30 20:13:14	naw397	This part coming up is sweet actually
2015-09-30 20:13:14	thekitsch	oh, you gonna styart speed running TP?
2015-09-30 20:13:33	radicllarry	This is one of the better 3D zeldas IMO
2015-09-30 20:13:34	tracedout	it has some really nice aesthetic composition
2015-09-30 20:13:57	siglemic	this game has moments where it looks pretty
2015-09-30 20:13:58	naw397	Look at those fun bags
2015-09-30 20:14:04	siglemic	but sometimes im like DansGame
2015-09-30 20:14:11	radicllarry	yeah twilight zones are ugly as fuck
2015-09-30 20:14:20	radicllarry	but some of the dungeons later on are very cool
2015-09-30 20:14:22	thesaurian	this game is great =D
2015-09-30 20:14:32	naw397	That woman is a butter boobs
2015-09-30 20:14:41	peacy3	i love the mid to late game dungeons
2015-09-30 20:14:41	randy_manhammer	BibleThump
2015-09-30 20:14:43	rendood	this lady is clearly gorgeous for instance
2015-09-30 20:14:45	sackjavone	They shouldn't have tried to make a realistic looking game on such weak hardware
2015-09-30 20:14:55	radicllarry	too many waifus in this game
2015-09-30 20:15:10	randy_manhammer	( BibleThump Y BibleThump )
2015-09-30 20:15:10	tmr69	this game isn't even remotely realistic looking
2015-09-30 20:15:13	tmr69	have you seen their faces
2015-09-30 20:15:18	fsbr_crush	some of the sounds in this game blow
2015-09-30 20:15:18	kabii_sama	escort mission time PogChamp
2015-09-30 20:15:42	radicllarry	The games OST isnt very memorable
2015-09-30 20:15:52	naw397	Well at the time I thought these graphics were incredible. You've gotta figure this followed major as mask
2015-09-30 20:15:57	rendood	environments, lighting and textures mostly TMR
2015-09-30 20:16:03	siglemic	this followed WW
2015-09-30 20:16:04	radicllarry	no this followed WW lol
2015-09-30 20:16:05	siglemic	lol

2015-09-30 20:16:42	kabii_sama	good god the entire time I've been watching this I've read so many conflicting opinions on nearly every aspect of the game
2015-09-30 20:16:49	naw397	Links like.", well she has nice tits"
2015-09-30 20:17:12	tracedout	everyone agrees the dungeons are good and twilight is bad kabii
2015-09-30 20:17:13	kabii_sama	like some people love this graphical style, others hate it
2015-09-30 20:17:17	tmr69	best boss fight in the game
2015-09-30 20:17:35	sackjavone	Actually it followed minish cap ***
2015-09-30 20:17:36	kabii_sama	actuslly someone yesterday said they enjoyed the Twilight Sections
2015-09-30 20:17:42	fsbr_crush	how much dopamine can you get from a game like this
2015-09-30 20:17:45	kabii_sama	cause they were easy
2015-09-30 20:17:56	sackjavone	* I actually don't know Kappa
2015-09-30 20:18:14	brookxiii	lol
2015-09-30 20:18:23	siglemic	cant hit the kid
2015-09-30 20:18:34	tmr69	crush this game is meant to help you replenish your dopamine while you wait for the next zelda game
2015-09-30 20:18:38	rottking	haha
2015-09-30 20:18:44	naw397	Yeah it's difficult

2015-09-30 20:20:09	kabii_sama	the way this "fight" works is weird
2015-09-30 20:20:29	kabii_sama	you gotta shoot him twice and if you fall off his health resets
2015-09-30 20:20:53	naw397	The one you hit with your sword is much harder
2015-09-30 20:20:58	kabii_sama	yeah
2015-09-30 20:21:05	brookxiii	sig's like "screams of terror? better ignore it"
2015-09-30 20:21:25	tmr69	i wouldn't hire sig to protect my caravans
2015-09-30 20:21:26	naw397	They are screams of joy

2015-09-30 20:23:25	aarondill	he clearly tried to pull an ocarina of time on that gate

2015-09-30 20:23:57	davencia	I feel like picking up this game again so badly
2015-09-30 20:24:08	tmr69	sick aim
2015-09-30 20:24:19	davencia	Was actually pretty nice aim
2015-09-30 20:24:23	tmr69	yeah
2015-09-30 20:24:28	kabii_sama	also that was some godlike sniping
2015-09-30 20:24:35	wapish	um
2015-09-30 20:24:38	davencia	And it's on GC. I find it way easier on the Wii

2015-09-30 20:25:38	aarondill	I'm pretty sure the gale boomerang is the lamest item
2015-09-30 20:25:38	davencia	lel

2015-09-30 20:26:00	davencia	I wish they would make a new "Dark" Zelda game soon :c
2015-09-30 20:26:04	kabii_sama	also the Gale Boomerang is the best item in speedruns
2015-09-30 20:27:17	davencia	Cya later guys. Ya'll have a nice day mangoFox /
2015-09-30 20:27:24	tmr69	you can sword these guys, it's easier
2015-09-30 20:27:27	tmr69	imo
2015-09-30 20:27:33	thesaurian	lock on would indeed help a lot
2015-09-30 20:28:26	trex7g2	Link is a crazy sniper with lock on when you think about it
2015-09-30 20:28:31	aarondill	the wonders of lock on
2015-09-30 20:28:36	barackoli	He's mongolian
2015-09-30 20:28:52	thesaurian	hahah
2015-09-30 20:29:16	aarondill	the boar riding parts of this game are the best imo
2015-09-30 20:29:20	thesaurian	epona is arrow proof Kappa
2015-09-30 20:29:23	peacy3	lol
2015-09-30 20:29:33	tmr69	maybe i was wrong
2015-09-30 20:29:37	thesaurian	and sword proof Kappa
2015-09-30 20:29:46	kabii_sama	just practically stabbed Epona lol
2015-09-30 20:31:03	thesaurian	point blank misses ahah

2015-09-30 20:32:15	tmr69	did that moblin rider really just drown himself
2015-09-30 20:32:25	siglemic	??
2015-09-30 20:32:33	kabii_sama	well the water is just a puddle...
2015-09-30 20:32:42	wapish	bird is troll
2015-09-30 20:32:46	tracedout	when the cart takes too much damage it does a lap
2015-09-30 20:32:49	tracedout	instead of progressing
2015-09-30 20:32:52	kabii_sama	sig watch the cart and ignore the Bulbins on the boars
2015-09-30 20:33:13	indiemademarble	hit the bird
2015-09-30 20:33:38	tmr69	why does zant wanna kill link's gf so badly
2015-09-30 20:33:48	tmr69	errr
2015-09-30 20:33:54	tmr69	if that's a spoiler delete msg?
2015-09-30 20:33:54	kabii_sama	who the hell knows
2015-09-30 20:34:05	kabii_sama	not really a spoiler
2015-09-30 20:34:23	tmr69	last time i played this game was like 20 yrs ago so kinda forgot storyline order
2015-09-30 20:34:26	tmr69	ah
2015-09-30 20:34:43	aarondill	wow did he just deflect that arrow mid air with his sword?
2015-09-30 20:34:44	aarondill	sick moves
2015-09-30 20:34:59	kabii_sama	well the Bulblins on the boars are all under the command of King Bulblin
2015-09-30 20:35:23	highgamer313	they are in the trees and cliffs thats why they keep turning like that
2015-09-30 20:35:30	tmr69	they still boys with zant tho
2015-09-30 20:35:35	kabii_sama	tbh I'm not even sure if King Bulblin is really a servent of Zant
2015-09-30 20:35:36	tracedout	the bird drops a bomb on it
2015-09-30 20:36:11	kabii_sama	but he helps spread the Twilight at the start of the game so I guess they're all together
2015-09-30 20:36:50	tmr69	yeah
2015-09-30 20:36:52	aarondill	I love the costumes in this game
2015-09-30 20:37:07	radicllarry	The cutscenes in this game make it feel like a jrpg
2015-09-30 20:37:45	thesaurian	its all about the story telling this game
2015-09-30 20:37:46	barackoli	Well it is a jrpg
2015-09-30 20:38:17	tmr69	this game is def more jrpg-esque than other zeldas
2015-09-30 20:38:22	happyhotel	GRIL
2015-09-30 20:38:53	glassesnhoodie	lol not really no
2015-09-30 20:39:08	radicllarry	TITS
2015-09-30 20:39:20	radicllarry	close your eyes siglemic
2015-09-30 20:39:33	steveobroil	cosmoBONK
2015-09-30 20:39:38	kabii_sama	Serenade of Water Kreygasm
2015-09-30 20:40:02	aarondill	is the story any different in the wii version? I can't really remember some of this
2015-09-30 20:40:08	kabii_sama	nah
2015-09-30 20:40:21	glassesnhoodie	same game just mirrored
2015-09-30 20:40:29	aarondill	I guess it's just been too long
2015-09-30 20:41:16	tmr69	i love the zora tunic in this game
2015-09-30 20:41:19	radicllarry	game is surprisingly long
2015-09-30 20:41:23	boreh32	love it
2015-09-30 20:41:30	aarondill	yeah it looks stylish as hell
2015-09-30 20:41:30	tmr69	luv
2015-09-30 20:41:33	rendood	I love how it actually looks like its own thing
2015-09-30 20:41:39	rendood	rather than just a skin of the green one
2015-09-30 20:41:47	kabii_sama	lol, another thing people have conflicting opinions on
2015-09-30 20:42:05	aarondill	I also love how it makes you swim better even though it's made of metal scales
2015-09-30 20:42:10	steveobroil	the flippers are a bit gay
2015-09-30 20:42:12	kabii_sama	in speedrun streams people tend to hate on the Zora Armor for how goofy it looks
2015-09-30 20:42:22	boreh32	flippers <3
2015-09-30 20:42:24	tmr69	the only goofy thing about it are the flippers
2015-09-30 20:42:27	kabii_sama	personally I like it
2015-09-30 20:42:34	rendood	I do like it
2015-09-30 20:42:40	aarondill	I'm pretty sure I used the zora outfit all the time after I got it
2015-09-30 20:42:44	tmr69	but flippers were always a thing in zelda games so it makes sense
2015-09-30 20:42:55	rendood	zora makes you weaker though, right?
2015-09-30 20:43:00	tmr69	to fire
2015-09-30 20:43:01	tmr69	dmg
2015-09-30 20:43:07	kabii_sama	to extreme temperatures
2015-09-30 20:43:08	rendood	oh wait, crap. that is possibly a spoiler. sorry
2015-09-30 20:43:10	aarondill	yeah but style points
2015-09-30 20:43:16	siglemic	it's not
2015-09-30 20:43:17	steveobroil	coz fire counters water...?
2015-09-30 20:43:21	siglemic	the fairy chick just said
2015-09-30 20:43:21	kabii_sama	you take like 5 times normal damage
2015-09-30 20:43:24	siglemic	makes u weak to fire/ice
2015-09-30 20:43:24	rendood	ah cool
2015-09-30 20:43:41	rendood	paid literally no attention to the text just now
2015-09-30 20:43:44	rendood	go me
2015-09-30 20:44:13	aarondill	inb4 the sunlight burns him to ashes
2015-09-30 20:44:23	thesaurian	wat is this twilight Kappa
2015-09-30 20:45:14	poplzerz	Is this a speed run ?
2015-09-30 20:45:23	poplzerz	Why is skyward sword so gay
2015-09-30 20:45:36	boreh32	links pouty lips?
2015-09-30 20:45:42	tracedout	because miyamoto is bisexual
2015-09-30 20:45:48	poplzerz	^^
2015-09-30 20:46:12	poplzerz	I wonder if miyamoto has a daughter I can fap to
2015-09-30 20:46:27	tmr69	u weird ass nigga
2015-09-30 20:46:43	poplzerz	Did you just call me "weird"
2015-09-30 20:47:05	poplzerz	I'll let you know I am not a weird
2015-09-30 20:47:06	tmr69	no, talking to tracedout and boreh
2015-09-30 20:47:25	poplzerz	Weirds are scum
2015-09-30 20:47:37	poplzerz	Weirds are theives
2015-09-30 20:48:16	jimbojambos	HEEYA
2015-09-30 20:48:28	aarondill	I wonder why they changed the carrots into spurs
2015-09-30 20:48:40	aarondill	carrots are definitely healthier than spurs
2015-09-30 20:48:53	jimbojambos	i thought they were bullet holes with wheat coming out of them @Aarondill
2015-09-30 20:48:53	steveobroil	coz fuck epona
2015-09-30 20:48:57	poplzerz	Oi little goron
2015-09-30 20:49:01	aarondill	wat
2015-09-30 20:49:05	poplzerz	I fap to dragons
2015-09-30 20:49:32	poplzerz	RIP HORSE
2015-09-30 20:49:36	tmr69	you abuse epona like crazy
2015-09-30 20:49:58	poplzerz	Some get the animal rights service on this man
2015-09-30 20:50:01	aarondill	epona is the hero we don't deserve
2015-09-30 20:50:15	poplzerz	Lock him up
2015-09-30 20:52:25	jimbojambos	HE IS NOT EVEN HOLDING ONTO THE CHICKEN!!
2015-09-30 20:52:59	aarondill	he's trying to stop the chicken from pushing him down, duh
2015-09-30 20:53:04	brookxiii	chicken abuse as well, link is so heavy for a bird that small!!
2015-09-30 20:53:41	tracedout	the bird likes the abuse though so it's ok
2015-09-30 20:54:36	steveobroil	mlg
2015-09-30 20:54:43	thesaurian	nailed it!
2015-09-30 20:56:16	peacy3	because everyone loves a water dungeon...
2015-09-30 20:56:42	radicllarry	IIRC this game's water dungeon is legit
2015-09-30 20:56:49	radicllarry	its been a while though
2015-09-30 20:56:50	tracedout	yeah this is a good dungeon
2015-09-30 20:57:06	kabii_sama	it's pretty complicated, but I enjoy it
2015-09-30 20:57:11	brookxiii	i got super turned around in this dungeon when i first played this game
2015-09-30 20:57:17	brookxiii	i was pretty young though
2015-09-30 20:57:40	tmr69	guantanamo bay prisoners like water dungeons ( ͡͡ ° ͜ ʖ ͡ °)

2015-10-01 01:41:00	spoonfullofpasta	Sig your hear about the new tech
2015-10-01 01:41:18	mrmasochist	what tech?
2015-10-01 01:42:30	spoonfullofpasta	V canceling, if you press one of the shoulder buttons in a like 3 frame window after you get hit it cancels your velocity by 5%
2015-10-01 01:43:20	spoonfullofpasta	something like that, there's a reddit thread about it on ssbm, people said it was intentionally put in melee, so after 13 years they finally figured it out... So nuts
2015-10-01 01:43:25	simpleflips	$IG
2015-10-01 01:44:23	pahchi	you guys talk about v-canceling yet

2015-10-01 01:44:55	spoonfullofpasta	I just sent a couple of messages about it, but I prob explained it pretty shitty

2015-10-01 01:45:52	spoonfullofpasta	It's nuts how that was intentionally put in the game, and nobody knew about it.
2015-10-01 01:46:10	pahchi	yea spoon thats melee for you lol
2015-10-01 01:46:40	mrmasochist	that's fucking crazy
2015-10-01 01:47:24	mrmasochist	maybe some of the pros knew about it and that's why they live so god damn long D:<

2015-10-01 01:49:58	mrfirestorm	oh man more tech that makes me not want to learn melee BibleThump

2015-10-01 01:51:20	mrfirestorm	Project M Kreygasm
2015-10-01 01:51:24	improveurgame	@Mrfirestorm, idk, the amazing thing about the game is its easy to pick up and play but insanely hard to master
2015-10-01 01:51:40	mrfirestorm	No smash 4 is easy to pick up Kappa
2015-10-01 01:51:47	fireredruby20	it is
2015-10-01 01:51:48	improveurgame	KappaPride
2015-10-01 01:51:48	mrmasochist	5% percent doesn't sound like a lot, but if you already have really good DI it'll be that much harder to kill you
2015-10-01 01:51:55	mrfirestorm	but yea, starting to learn all the advanced stuff is really hard and overwelming :/
2015-10-01 01:51:56	gnaryrox	damn, this fight tho
2015-10-01 01:51:59	elerich	smash 4 only costs $60 to pick up Kppa
2015-10-01 01:52:09	boreh32	gg
2015-10-01 01:52:10	elerich	PogChamp nice fight sig
2015-10-01 01:52:12	gnaryrox	UEAH!!
2015-10-01 01:52:14	mrfirestorm	I play a lot of smash games actually lol
2015-10-01 01:52:28	fireredruby20	3 smash games?
2015-10-01 01:52:41	mrfirestorm	I play project m melee and smash 64 casually and I'm alright at sm4sh
2015-10-01 01:52:51	mrfirestorm	I never really thought about it.
2015-10-01 01:52:55	fireredruby20	cool selection :)
2015-10-01 01:53:02	mrfirestorm	Brawls is really cool but its not for me
2015-10-01 01:53:06	mrfirestorm	Also meta knight kinda ruins it
2015-10-01 01:53:13	elerich	no one masters smash 64 anymore BibleThump
2015-10-01 01:53:20	fireredruby20	except sm4sh imo, yeah Brawl took the series in the wrong direction
2015-10-01 01:53:33	mrfirestorm	I don't think it was wrong it was just really different
2015-10-01 01:53:38	risefallen	why master it when you can cheese your friends with jiggly and kirby Kappa
2015-10-01 01:53:39	mrfirestorm	Brawl has by far the coolest neutral game imo
2015-10-01 01:54:00	fireredruby20	i see, i haven't played it in soo long though
2015-10-01 01:54:08	mrfirestorm	because its purely reads/ psychology
2015-10-01 01:54:24	mrfirestorm	but because of that its not very fast paced
2015-10-01 01:54:33	mrfirestorm	and I love the fast paced nature of smash.
2015-10-01 01:54:44	fireredruby20	lol cool, reads are the best, yeah, i love the speed
2015-10-01 01:54:53	risefallen	have you seen the falco vs fox too assisted fight in brawl?
2015-10-01 01:55:02	risefallen	fast paced Kappa
2015-10-01 01:55:05	mrfirestorm	Its the same reason I think street fighter 3: third strike is my favorite fighting game.
2015-10-01 01:55:10	mrfirestorm	super fast and feels great
2015-10-01 01:55:20	mrfirestorm	also mechanically challenging
2015-10-01 01:55:20	risefallen	tool assisted*
2015-10-01 01:55:33	mrfirestorm	tool assisted smash things always bore me.
2015-10-01 01:55:46	risefallen	but have you seen the brawl fox vs falco?
2015-10-01 01:55:50	mrfirestorm	yea
2015-10-01 01:55:53	risefallen	it might as well be dragon ball z
2015-10-01 01:57:15	mrfirestorm	I think in the end if I ever wanted to go pro at a smash game it could only be smash4/ 64
2015-10-01 01:57:19	fireredruby20	watching great melee play looks like DBZ imo
2015-10-01 01:57:25	vanphann	May I play?
2015-10-01 01:57:43	mrfirestorm	my fingers do not move fast enough to do all the tech skill needed for pm/melee
2015-10-01 01:57:50	mrfirestorm	to play at a super high level.
2015-10-01 01:57:57	gnaryrox	GGs btw @Siglemic :D
2015-10-01 01:58:13	vanphann	I would like to play~~
2015-10-01 01:58:19	risefallen	you gotta stand up like hbox for optimal inputs :P
2015-10-01 01:58:24	mrfirestorm	Lol
2015-10-01 01:58:39	mrfirestorm	I would never play like hbox, though I do respect him for how he plays
2015-10-01 01:59:03	fireredruby20	i love how you can get really quick kills in melee with skill
2015-10-01 01:59:11	mrfirestorm	yea
2015-10-01 01:59:17	mrfirestorm	M2k fd marth Kreygasm
2015-10-01 01:59:52	mrfirestorm	Marth is so sick
2015-10-01 01:59:59	risefallen	dair to oblivion with marth Kreygasm
2015-10-01 02:00:14	mrfirestorm	My favorite change in the smash 4 notes was the nerf to marth Kappa
2015-10-01 02:00:25	risefallen	what was that?
2015-10-01 02:00:35	mrfirestorm	they nerfed his neutral b I think
2015-10-01 02:00:46	mrfirestorm	his neutral b's shield damage or something
2015-10-01 02:01:01	risefallen	but insta breaking shields was fun :(
2015-10-01 02:01:04	mrfirestorm	Its funny because both marth and Lucian (thye both got nerfed) are pretty bad
2015-10-01 02:01:22	fireredruby20	that's why i don't like Sm4sh :( they can balance it but they don't even try
2015-10-01 02:01:23	mrfirestorm	All the mid tiers are purely for niche counter picks
2015-10-01 02:01:41	nox_7	ooooOOooh
2015-10-01 02:01:43	mrfirestorm	yea but I'm actually decent at smash 4...
2015-10-01 02:01:54	mrfirestorm	I acutally like the counter pick nature of the game well kinda of
2015-10-01 02:01:57	fireman2220	cuze everyone is..
2015-10-01 02:02:03	fireredruby20	cool, I SD a lot in sm4sh for some reason xD
2015-10-01 02:02:14	risefallen	counter? just play zss Kappa
2015-10-01 02:02:15	mrfirestorm	I would not call any fighting game easy lol
2015-10-01 02:02:31	mrfirestorm	but yes smash 4 is easier compaired to other smash games I guess
2015-10-01 02:02:33	fireman2220	never said so. but its pretty easy to be decent at sm4sh
2015-10-01 02:02:35	mrfirestorm	it also is just a really different game.
2015-10-01 02:02:36	fireredruby20	counter pick = Sheik
2015-10-01 02:02:58	mrfirestorm	I'm so happy every one I play with does not use sheik at least for the most part.
2015-10-01 02:03:16	mrfirestorm	but yea no shiek changes as far as I know which was really funny.
2015-10-01 02:03:48	fireredruby20	I'd rather play Sheik than anything campy/gimmicky
2015-10-01 02:03:53	wuhmbo	!song
2015-10-01 02:03:54	dumbhero	most of the changes were just customs
2015-10-01 02:04:09	foo_fighter000	Is this Ellie Goulding?
2015-10-01 02:04:11	mrfirestorm	I play doc
2015-10-01 02:04:22	mrfirestorm	yea
2015-10-01 02:04:22	risefallen	whew
2015-10-01 02:04:25	foo_fighter000	@siglemic you goin to TBH5?
2015-10-01 02:04:37	unknownperson3	sam?
2015-10-01 02:04:40	mrfirestorm	I agree, all the new characters I dislike in smash 4 are just lazy projectile characters.
2015-10-01 02:04:50	mrfirestorm	also no snake/wolf zzzz
2015-10-01 02:05:12	fireredruby20	^yes, I love those thoughts
2015-10-01 02:05:32	mrfirestorm	I don't mind a few projectile base characters because some people enjoy them
2015-10-01 02:05:47	mrfirestorm	but so many of the new characters they added are just projectile spam
2015-10-01 02:06:06	dumbhero	the only projectile based character i mind is link
2015-10-01 02:06:12	mrfirestorm	Yea
2015-10-01 02:06:18	mrfirestorm	Also they kept sonic
2015-10-01 02:06:22	mrfirestorm	I fucking hate sonic
2015-10-01 02:06:29	fireredruby20	and Spacies,
2015-10-01 02:06:30	dumbhero	fuck sonic
2015-10-01 02:06:35	mrfirestorm	literally the worst designed character in any smash game imo
2015-10-01 02:06:37	fireredruby20	I HATE Sonic
2015-10-01 02:06:45	foo_fighter000	@mrfirestorm nah, you're just too slow
2015-10-01 02:06:47	mrfirestorm	He is everything I dislike that smash could be in one character
2015-10-01 02:06:51	fireredruby20	all he does is spin
2015-10-01 02:06:57	fireredruby20	he has one move basically
2015-10-01 02:07:05	mrfirestorm	I don't blame people for pick him but I hate his design
2015-10-01 02:07:08	mrfirestorm	its so bad imo.
2015-10-01 02:07:12	halqerylive	Luigi isn't even fun to play against in smash 4
2015-10-01 02:07:18	dumbhero	as far as spacies, i prefer falco
2015-10-01 02:07:29	mrfirestorm	Yea I like falco more than fox
2015-10-01 02:07:34	mrfirestorm	but thats because I like style
2015-10-01 02:07:46	fireredruby20	nice Marth win <3
2015-10-01 02:07:47	dumbhero	same
2015-10-01 02:07:48	mrfirestorm	my favorite character in melee is prob doc but marth and falco is pretty high up there
2015-10-01 02:07:53	mrfirestorm	and then I guess falcon?
2015-10-01 02:07:58	mrfirestorm	Kreygasm
2015-10-01 02:08:11	mrfirestorm	I don't like fox/sheik much
2015-10-01 02:08:25	mrfirestorm	I guess in pm my favorite character in gannon?
2015-10-01 02:08:34	mrfirestorm	yea tis most likely ganon then snake
2015-10-01 02:08:38	mrfirestorm	its*
2015-10-01 02:08:40	dumbhero	can we trade sonic for young link and just drop toon link altogether?
2015-10-01 02:08:47	nox_7	tis a ganon main
2015-10-01 02:09:01	mrfirestorm	I actually loved young link
2015-10-01 02:09:04	mrfirestorm	was so much fun
2015-10-01 02:09:09	mrfirestorm	well is so much fun
2015-10-01 02:09:09	fireredruby20	I love seeing Westballz style his movement with Falco
2015-10-01 02:09:12	mrfirestorm	Hey nox
2015-10-01 02:09:18	nox_7	hi
2015-10-01 02:09:20	nox_7	i love marth
2015-10-01 02:09:27	nox_7	and marth-like things
2015-10-01 02:09:28	mrfirestorm	Yea West ballz is what I feel most people love in pro melee
2015-10-01 02:09:30	mrfirestorm	Yea same
2015-10-01 02:09:32	mrfirestorm	marth is really fun
2015-10-01 02:09:34	fireredruby20	I like Pichu, he's my favorite low-tier
2015-10-01 02:10:17	mrfirestorm	When a marth is on fire its amazing to watch
2015-10-01 02:10:17	dumbhero	if smash 4 were to ever get a patch giving it melee or pm mechanics it'd be a godlike game
2015-10-01 02:10:24	game_of_skill	d'was good
2015-10-01 02:10:33	mrfirestorm	to see some one have so much control over a game is just insane
2015-10-01 02:10:40	fireredruby20	I love that up-d edge guard
2015-10-01 02:10:45	mrfirestorm	Not really
2015-10-01 02:10:58	mrfirestorm	The fundementally is nothing like them even with the tech added back in
2015-10-01 02:11:05	mrfirestorm	Like how grabs are the most important thing in smash 4
2015-10-01 02:11:13	mrfirestorm	and it pretty decideds most characters if they're good or not
2015-10-01 02:11:20	nox_7	i just got my first college math quiz back
2015-10-01 02:11:23	mrfirestorm	they either are super safe/campy or have good grab combos.
2015-10-01 02:11:23	nox_7	90
2015-10-01 02:11:25	nox_7	lets go
2015-10-01 02:11:25	siglemic	just have to wait this guy out cuz hes a double jumping degenerate
2015-10-01 02:11:36	gnaryrox	GG!
2015-10-01 02:11:38	mrfirestorm	LOL
2015-10-01 02:11:43	mrfirestorm	Also I can't play with tap jump
2015-10-01 02:11:46	mrfirestorm	its impossible
2015-10-01 02:11:47	xtrako	worst thing about sm4sh is that shield is way too strong
2015-10-01 02:11:49	dumbhero	savage sig
2015-10-01 02:11:51	nox_7	whats a degenerate
2015-10-01 02:11:54	mrfirestorm	I agree
2015-10-01 02:11:55	xtrako	so grabs become the only option
2015-10-01 02:11:57	nox_7	am i a degenerate
2015-10-01 02:11:58	truespcb	me
2015-10-01 02:12:05	luis937	siglemic got no chill
2015-10-01 02:12:12	mrfirestorm	But they can't just nerf shields because every top teir will just get even better
2015-10-01 02:12:28	fireredruby20	Directional air-dodging would make it better, and also just revamping a lot of move-sets
2015-10-01 02:12:56	fireredruby20	just give Smash back to HAL Laboratories
2015-10-01 02:13:06	mrzhk	I disagree, nerfing shield changes the tier list, not just enhancing the top
2015-10-01 02:13:11	mrfirestorm	I would like Directional air dodging even if they remove wave dashing lol
2015-10-01 02:13:19	fireredruby20	me too^
2015-10-01 02:13:27	mrfirestorm	because I would allow for wave landing
2015-10-01 02:13:33	mrfirestorm	and wave landing is the best part of melee imo
2015-10-01 02:13:41	mrfirestorm	it maeks platform movement so great
2015-10-01 02:13:44	xtrako	i think shield nerf would change the entire tier list but its not about the balance. It would just make gameplay better overall
2015-10-01 02:13:46	nox_7	oooooooooooooooh
2015-10-01 02:13:49	nox_7	that was tight
2015-10-01 02:14:00	mrfirestorm	Yea but every top teir atm has great shield pressure
2015-10-01 02:14:09	nox_7	OH JESUS
2015-10-01 02:14:27	mrzhk	balancing isn't what smash 4 needs though, only sheik is unbalanced because she's the only one with no bad match-ups.
2015-10-01 02:14:31	fireredruby20	I like directional air-dodging cause then you can't just air-dodge way off stage and be safe
2015-10-01 02:15:18	mrfirestorm	Also Direcetional air dodging allows for mix up's for recovery's which makes some characters with weaker ones better
2015-10-01 02:15:52	mrzhk	The shield change helps fast, aggressive characters like sheik, fox, little mac, and it hurts characters with no approach like dedede or robin
2015-10-01 02:15:59	fireredruby20	Also, recoveries in general should be weaker in Smash 4, it takes soo long to die
2015-10-01 02:16:17	mrfirestorm	Well thats true for half the cast
2015-10-01 02:16:27	mrzhk	I think that's why smash 4 is 2 stock instead of 3 stock
2015-10-01 02:16:41	mrzhk	Brawl had gimps and edge guarding
2015-10-01 02:16:42	iamcompensate	yo sig whats good
2015-10-01 02:16:48	mrfirestorm	I mean half the cast has godly recoverys and then you have stuff like doctor mario
2015-10-01 02:17:09	lorek	Is siggy on his local PR?
2015-10-01 02:17:38	fireredruby20	lol, poor Dr. M
2015-10-01 02:17:48	brocoop	could be worse
2015-10-01 02:17:52	mrfirestorm	I love dr. mario Kreygasm
2015-10-01 02:17:53	brocoop	could be duck hunt
2015-10-01 02:18:03	xtrako	at the same time I wouldn't want there to be retarded approaches like melee fox nair
2015-10-01 02:18:38	mrfirestorm	nox want to bop me in melee? Kappa /
2015-10-01 02:18:49	mrzhk	I prefer little mac to doctor mario in terms of recovery, since mac has two different recoveries excluding counter, and he has high priority on both
2015-10-01 02:19:09	fireredruby20	Dr. Mario > DuckHunt + Free baked chicken
2015-10-01 02:19:27	mrfirestorm	the only reason I think doc is beter in the recovery is because of the janky hitbox, AND you can jump during down b for massive height .
2015-10-01 02:19:31	mrfirestorm	so he has one really solid mixup
2015-10-01 02:19:52	mrfirestorm	plus his down b matchs a lot of spikes for some reason.
2015-10-01 02:20:27	angelus_lul	lol
2015-10-01 02:20:32	mrzhk	mac's side b is actually really hard to punish, and mac's up b hits through the stage. doc is easier to gimp imo
2015-10-01 02:20:43	mrfirestorm	True
2015-10-01 02:20:51	mrfirestorm	but like I said doc's upb has a super janky hibox
2015-10-01 02:20:55	mrfirestorm	hitbox*
2015-10-01 02:20:58	benjaminleigh	these shines are godlike
2015-10-01 02:21:04	mrfirestorm	It swear its ripped straight from melee
2015-10-01 02:21:10	mrfirestorm	its super square for some reason
2015-10-01 02:21:36	fireredruby20	JV! JV!
2015-10-01 02:21:43	xtrako	he is wasting both of his jumps so often. sig caught on real quick lol
2015-10-01 02:21:43	mrzhk	siglemic channeling is hatred towards cactuar against this marth
2015-10-01 02:23:43	daddyquitdrinking	siglemic is from oregon or washington?
2015-10-01 02:23:46	mrfirestorm	Falco PogChamp
2015-10-01 02:24:14	mrfirestorm	washington I believe
2015-10-01 02:24:28	mrfirestorm	Is Vancouver in Washington?
2015-10-01 02:24:38	daddyquitdrinking	gotcha. he was in my pool at smashnest 4.5 but I didn't get to play hom
2015-10-01 02:24:47	mrfirestorm	I don't know Us's geography
2015-10-01 02:24:53	daddyquitdrinking	and yeah its right on the border of oregon and washington
2015-10-01 02:24:55	clintonstevenson	Will v-canceling shift the meta?
2015-10-01 02:25:08	truespcb	let's find out
2015-10-01 02:25:28	fireredruby20	what's v-cancelling?
2015-10-01 02:25:36	mrfirestorm	I think the biggest change will be in how people kill?
2015-10-01 02:25:37	daddyquitdrinking	new tech just discovered
2015-10-01 02:25:41	mrfirestorm	but it could not have a big effect on the game.
2015-10-01 02:25:42	goexplode	kirby ftw
2015-10-01 02:25:45	clintonstevenson	https://www.reddit.com/r/SSBM/comments/3n1kgf/new_global_technique_discovery_vcanceling_reduce/
2015-10-01 02:25:47	daddyquitdrinking	I don't think it'll change much
2015-10-01 02:26:03	viscous_uly	wanna know how i take off my condom?
2015-10-01 02:26:04	fireredruby20	thnx Clinton
2015-10-01 02:26:04	daddyquitdrinking	it's only 5% difference. might matter in very specific scenarios
2015-10-01 02:26:15	truespcb	i guess matches being a little longer isn't too bad
2015-10-01 02:26:25	angelus_lul	lol
2015-10-01 02:28:20	mrfirestorm	I heard there was talk of lowering the timer for melee I don't really know why
2015-10-01 02:28:36	truespcb	dumb as hell
2015-10-01 02:28:36	brocoop	matches never go to time out
2015-10-01 02:28:38	clintonstevenson	cuz hbox
2015-10-01 02:28:40	mrfirestorm	It does not run out of time very often but when it does its been prettyhypre moe of the time.

2015-10-01 02:50:09	mrfirestorm	what was your main?
2015-10-01 02:50:10	fireredruby20	i think if you sleep well, you would, as a result, be happy
2015-10-01 02:50:26	dumbhero	my fox is trash lol
2015-10-01 02:50:34	sleepyk	what's with the raphael purplerobocop kirby
2015-10-01 02:50:34	strong_badam	i mained fox when i quit melee, when i came back to ssbm for a while i mained sheik
2015-10-01 02:50:57	mrfirestorm	The problem was you were not a marth main
2015-10-01 02:51:04	strong_badam	marth is too hard
2015-10-01 02:51:06	zneakyd	@Fireredruby20 depends why your not happy in the first place tho
2015-10-01 02:51:47	mrfirestorm	I hate the sound samus makes when she wave dashes so much
2015-10-01 02:52:01	mrfirestorm	worst sound ever made by man.
2015-10-01 02:52:09	dumbhero	woman*
2015-10-01 02:52:16	dumbhero	Kappa
2015-10-01 02:52:28	strong_badam	im not good enough at melee to play marth the way he should look
2015-10-01 02:52:30	fireredruby20	yea, i guess you can sleep a lot and not be happy
2015-10-01 02:52:37	strong_badam	so i just play sheik lolol
2015-10-01 02:52:41	mrfirestorm	thats ghow I feel about all smash games lol

2015-10-01 02:52:51	mrfirestorm	why do you think I play Ganon in project M LOL
2015-10-01 02:52:55	sleepyk	cuz once u get grabbed its ogre
2015-10-01 02:53:02	mrfirestorm	... sleepy plz
2015-10-01 02:53:06	zneakyd	i think peach has the worst ever sound. when she says "oh did i win"
2015-10-01 02:53:11	strong_badam	i hate you so much sleepyk
2015-10-01 02:53:19	dumbhero	i'm decent with marth but prefer young link or puff myself
2015-10-01 02:53:23	sleepyk	smashDuna
2015-10-01 02:53:32	zneakyd	i'm like " fuck you Peach "
2015-10-01 02:53:36	fireredruby20	I think you mean Sanic
2015-10-01 02:53:36	mrfirestorm	Young link. marth, falco, Doc Kreygasm
2015-10-01 02:53:57	zneakyd	Fox voice is Kreygasm
2015-10-01 02:54:04	zneakyd	only melee fox tho
2015-10-01 02:54:09	nubetatester	sleepy cirMini /
2015-10-01 02:54:12	sleepyk	zup
2015-10-01 02:54:36	dumbhero	i have trouble with falco :/
2015-10-01 02:54:48	mrfirestorm	oh I can't play them but I love them on in concept lol
2015-10-01 02:54:50	mrfirestorm	I'm awful
2015-10-01 02:54:52	zneakyd	@Dumbhero playing against or playing as?
2015-10-01 02:55:01	dumbhero	playing as
2015-10-01 02:55:15	zneakyd	is it his wave dash?
2015-10-01 02:55:27	zneakyd	it is always his wavedash, the timing is just so odd
2015-10-01 02:55:32	dingo2345	Is this VS CPU?
2015-10-01 02:55:37	sleepyk	he's playing online
2015-10-01 02:55:44	dumbhero	that's exactly it
2015-10-01 02:56:08	dumbhero	half the time i don't even bother trying to wave dash with him
2015-10-01 02:56:14	zneakyd	it is such a struggle, just think of doing the inputs slower
2015-10-01 02:56:26	zneakyd	and just practise wave dash back and forth on fd slowly
2015-10-01 02:56:27	strong_badam	i can play like 20 chars in pm, i instantly adjust wd timing
2015-10-01 02:56:43	mrfirestorm	fuk u strong
2015-10-01 02:56:47	mrfirestorm	y u so godo
2015-10-01 02:56:50	mrfirestorm	good*
2015-10-01 02:56:50	zneakyd	and then you increase in speed when you feel you got it
2015-10-01 02:57:11	strong_badam	the weird ones are bowser/ddd bc theyre the slowest, by themselves
2015-10-01 02:57:16	strong_badam	3-5 frame jumpsquat ez
2015-10-01 02:57:32	zneakyd	falco is 6 or 7 i think
2015-10-01 02:57:38	strong_badam	falcos is 5
2015-10-01 02:57:40	dumbhero	i know what i'm doing most of the day tomorrow
2015-10-01 02:57:57	strong_badam	airborne frame 6
2015-10-01 02:58:02	zneakyd	have to look up frame data
2015-10-01 02:58:55	zneakyd	true
2015-10-01 02:59:27	zneakyd	i feel that it is very easy to wavedash with every character except dk, bowser and falco
2015-10-01 02:59:46	zneakyd	when i play falco i miss 1/5 of my wavedashes
2015-10-01 02:59:56	strong_badam	cant imagine why youd have trouble with them but not others with the same timing like peach
2015-10-01 03:00:19	strong_badam	falcon too
2015-10-01 03:00:19	mrfirestorm	idk could just be a mental block
2015-10-01 03:00:19	zneakyd	i barely never play peach
2015-10-01 03:00:24	zneakyd	falcon is easy
2015-10-01 03:00:31	strong_badam	same timing as falco
2015-10-01 03:00:40	zneakyd	is it?
2015-10-01 03:00:41	solderious	Falco wave dashing wasn't that easy at first for me but if you just practice it's actually very easy to pull off
2015-10-01 03:01:05	fireredruby20	You "barely never play Peach"? So you're a Peach Main eh?
2015-10-01 03:01:13	zneakyd	nope
2015-10-01 03:01:18	zneakyd	lol
2015-10-01 03:01:20	fireredruby20	haha lol k
2015-10-01 03:01:23	strong_badam	oh no i think im wrong on falcon
2015-10-01 03:01:37	strong_badam	uhhh what about roy
2015-10-01 03:01:54	zneakyd	i believe he is airborne on frame 5?
2015-10-01 03:01:55	mrfirestorm	double negatives are the best Kappa
2015-10-01 03:02:15	zneakyd	i feel he is inbetween falco and marth in timing
2015-10-01 03:02:27	strong_badam	falcon is 5, roy is 6
2015-10-01 03:02:33	strong_badam	marth is airborne frame 5
2015-10-01 03:02:57	strong_badam	zzz i gotta sleep
2015-10-01 03:03:01	zneakyd	that explains why i have no problem wavedashing with falcon then
2015-10-01 03:03:08	zneakyd	i started maining marth in the start
2015-10-01 03:03:24	strong_badam	gnight sig & chat
2015-10-01 03:03:31	zneakyd	Gn
2015-10-01 03:03:36	mrfirestorm	hey strong bad

2015-10-01 03:16:02	sadnax13	play falco
2015-10-01 03:16:02	boreh32	nowhere usa
2015-10-01 03:16:09	kawaii421	my town has a pretty small melee scene, only like two other people a little better than me and one dude a lot better who doesn't play much
2015-10-01 03:16:15	sadnax13	smash your face on your controller and win
2015-10-01 03:16:40	kawaii421	luckily we have a lot of super scrubs who like coming to our stuff
2015-10-01 03:16:49	caysekong	the only other "good" melee player within a 30 mile radius of me is a falco and all he does is dair
2015-10-01 03:16:58	lorek	Then beat his ass
2015-10-01 03:17:01	hammerface80	dair is a good move you know
2015-10-01 03:17:04	hammerface80	one of the best
2015-10-01 03:17:12	lorek	If dair sucks so much why lose to it
2015-10-01 03:17:25	oobike	it's actually not bad to use when they recover on stage
2015-10-01 03:17:54	caysekong	im not saying its a bad move but its all he uses
2015-10-01 03:18:28	caysekong	doesnt bair, doesnt shine, he dairs rofl
2015-10-01 03:18:57	kawaii421	well he's like a super borp you know, play is simplified down to one move he uses really well :))
2015-10-01 03:19:10	hammerface80	dair is easier to land than shine
2015-10-01 03:19:29	caysekong	i just think its funny
2015-10-01 03:19:42	spikey00	Kreygasm
2015-10-01 03:19:54	hammerface80	hes probably better than me considering I can't even short hop consistently :^)
2015-10-01 03:20:09	caysekong	he can shffl dair like a mofo
2015-10-01 03:20:19	tittytris10	4 stockkkk! Kreygasm
2015-10-01 03:20:27	caysekong	no shines tho
2015-10-01 03:20:42	siglemic	lagging sooo bad
2015-10-01 03:20:51	hammerface80	i thinks its quite difficult to land a shine on the grand if you dont know how to wavedash
2015-10-01 03:20:56	hammerface80	on the ground
2015-10-01 03:21:10	siglemic	gettin someone else
2015-10-01 03:21:16	siglemic	i need dat smooth 60
2015-10-01 03:21:16	boreh32	yea
2015-10-01 03:21:18	acidlaugh	I'm getting multishines down but i can't wavedash consistently worth a shit
2015-10-01 03:21:19	siglemic	or i feel sad
2015-10-01 03:21:29	oobike	man I get that you gotta start somewhere but at least practice some tech :(
2015-10-01 03:21:40	mntempest	@Acidlaugh you should really work on waveshines instead then.
2015-10-01 03:21:40	caysekong	it comes with time.
2015-10-01 03:21:42	gull_ssbm	What's the highest buffer you will tolerate on netplay?
2015-10-01 03:21:47	deniussb	are u playin melee online or wtf
2015-10-01 03:21:48	siglemic	4
2015-10-01 03:21:49	mntempest	@Acidlaugh they are way more valuable
2015-10-01 03:21:57	kawaii421	tech is the easy part, it's just practice
2015-10-01 03:22:01	lorek	The midwest struggle
2015-10-01 03:22:02	lorek	4 is good
2015-10-01 03:22:14	gull_ssbm	Yeah I like 3 or less but I can play 4
2015-10-01 03:22:16	siglemic	4 is barely playable
2015-10-01 03:22:23	siglemic	after that it's no longer melee, it's a shitfest
2015-10-01 03:22:25	kawaii421	aren't there a lot of midwest netplay people? i always see a bunch of red when I look on smashladder
2015-10-01 03:22:25	mntempest	midwest just johns, we could be as good as the coasts
2015-10-01 03:23:24	lorek	Yeah midwest ping is just shit
2015-10-01 03:23:46	caysekong	im ready for ellie to release new tunes rofl
2015-10-01 03:24:28	fireredruby20	Smash "4 is barely playable"?
2015-10-01 03:24:39	acidlaugh	I am just so conflicted whether i even want to learn falco or not.
2015-10-01 03:25:04	oobike	falcos really fun I think
2015-10-01 03:25:27	iaimed	Smash 4 is terrible
2015-10-01 03:25:35	caysekong	pick one and run with it.
2015-10-01 03:26:03	ihaveaflag	Why do you feel like smash 4 is terrible?
2015-10-01 03:26:16	siglemic	that guy was a really shitty communicator lol
2015-10-01 03:26:33	acidlaugh	Smash 4 isn't terrible imo. Just rewards defensive gameplay which is kinda lame
2015-10-01 03:26:45	kawaii421	that's rude dude, future employers are gonna read this chat
2015-10-01 03:26:51	fireredruby20	Smash 4 feels boring
2015-10-01 03:27:09	siglemic	if i were an employer i would not hire that guy
2015-10-01 03:27:13	gull_ssbm	lol
2015-10-01 03:27:13	kawaii421	hahaha
2015-10-01 03:27:42	caysekong	hes prob the guy that works a drive thru and waits for the customer to talk first
2015-10-01 03:28:09	iaimed	"My b" it's just way too slow paced for me
2015-10-01 03:28:11	fireredruby20	an employer who doesn't hire Siglemic for that should get fired
2015-10-01 03:29:17	caysekong	did you guys read about the new tech lol
2015-10-01 03:29:25	mntempest	sheiks dumb
2015-10-01 03:29:38	acidlaugh	I feel like marth is the best character in todays meta based on lots of matchups
2015-10-01 03:30:20	kawaii421	marth is going to be the fox of the next generation
2015-10-01 03:30:26	kawaii421	and then we'll transition into falcon as falcon beats marth on fd
2015-10-01 03:30:34	acidlaugh	Yeah on fd
2015-10-01 03:30:38	mntempest	jesus christ sig approach
2015-10-01 03:30:42	kawaii421	it always starts on fd man
2015-10-01 03:30:47	acidlaugh	But i srsly think marth is the best
2015-10-01 03:30:48	kirurus	Melee is still my fav smash even though I <3 Bowser. >.<
2015-10-01 03:30:58	siglemic	im winning y approach

2015-10-01 03:31:20	fireredruby20	I just read v-canceling, sounds crazy
2015-10-01 03:31:33	caysekong	http://gfycat.com/FailingOfficialAfricanharrierhawk
2015-10-01 03:31:35	acidlaugh	Yeah what is v canceling?
2015-10-01 03:31:41	caysekong	^that^
2015-10-01 03:31:45	caysekong	is v canceling
2015-10-01 03:31:57	kawaii421	press digital trigger 2-3 frames after being hit
2015-10-01 03:32:01	kawaii421	reduce knockback by 5%
2015-10-01 03:32:14	gull_ssbm	I thought it was before not after
2015-10-01 03:32:19	kawaii421	oh
2015-10-01 03:32:25	fireredruby20	it's b4 i think
2015-10-01 03:32:25	acidlaugh	Damn
2015-10-01 03:32:27	kawaii421	check the reddit post
2015-10-01 03:32:28	acidlaugh	Mind blown
2015-10-01 03:32:38	fireredruby20	https://www.reddit.com/r/SSBM/comments/3n1kgf/new_global_technique_discovery_vcanceling_reduce/ this one?
2015-10-01 03:32:38	weskersuks	Wait, is there still tech being discovered in melee?
2015-10-01 03:32:44	weskersuks	My god this depth is too much
2015-10-01 03:32:46	kawaii421	yeah the one achilles made
2015-10-01 03:32:59	acidlaugh	I know tech still won't be discovered in sm4sh this long after its out
2015-10-01 03:33:03	acidlaugh	Melee is amazing
2015-10-01 03:33:16	kawaii421	oh so 2 frames before and the frame you are hit
2015-10-01 03:34:46	iamcompensate	v cancelling sounds complicated
2015-10-01 03:34:57	gull_ssbm	I wonder how many times people have accidentally performed it in tournaments
2015-10-01 03:35:05	caysekong	its like 3 frames, so yeh
2015-10-01 03:35:08	acidlaugh	Probably a lot
2015-10-01 03:35:18	caysekong	people probably have been doing it without realizing
2015-10-01 03:35:36	kawaii421	you can probably tech and v-cancel the same attack
2015-10-01 03:35:40	fireredruby20	Melee is awesome, it has better updates that Smash 4
2015-10-01 03:35:54	kawaii421	like amsah techs
2015-10-01 03:36:23	acidlaugh	Just "dont get hit"
2015-10-01 03:36:31	gull_ssbm	I don't like the name though, velocity is being reduced, not cancelled. Semantics though...
2015-10-01 03:36:39	sleepyk	how is an amsah tech like a vcancel
2015-10-01 03:36:56	kawaii421	im saying you could be v-cancelling an attack you amsah tech
2015-10-01 03:37:04	kawaii421	not on purpose but by virtue of pressing the button
2015-10-01 03:37:24	sleepyk	oic
2015-10-01 03:37:34	kawaii421	yeah, since the tech window could align with right before you get hit
2015-10-01 03:38:01	gull_ssbm	Still, you have to be Airborne to perform a V cancel
2015-10-01 03:38:16	acidlaugh	I wonder what some people were doing when they discovered tech in melee
2015-10-01 03:38:39	kawaii421	probably done by accident first
2015-10-01 03:38:50	acidlaugh	Like wavedashing seems like such a silly concept
2015-10-01 03:39:05	sleepyk	not really
2015-10-01 03:39:14	ssbmstuff	how is netplay these days? much lag/delay/etc. to have to adjust to?
2015-10-01 03:39:15	sleepyk	it has a logical progression of discovery
2015-10-01 03:39:27	sleepyk	it's much better than before
2015-10-01 03:39:41	caysekong	wavedashing was found on accident no
2015-10-01 03:39:44	caysekong	?
2015-10-01 03:39:55	kawaii421	ehh
2015-10-01 03:39:56	caysekong	some luigi guy idk
2015-10-01 03:39:57	sleepyk	which isn't saying a whole lot
2015-10-01 03:39:58	sleepyk	no
2015-10-01 03:40:00	ssbmstuff	yeah I remember it was horrific in the beginning. but cool all the same 'cause it was fricken ssbm netplay lol
2015-10-01 03:40:06	sleepyk	devs discovered it
2015-10-01 03:40:09	kawaii421	^
2015-10-01 03:40:10	sleepyk	left it in the game
2015-10-01 03:40:11	dolphintv	hi sleepyk Kreygasm
2015-10-01 03:40:19	sleepyk	japanese players have been wavedashing since 2001
2015-10-01 03:40:23	caysekong	i knew that but did devs tell us about it rofl
2015-10-01 03:40:27	caysekong	ah idk
2015-10-01 03:40:31	thegamedroid	lol

2015-10-01 03:40:53	sleepyk	according to some recollections they'd been doing it prior too
2015-10-01 03:41:01	sleepyk	also hi dolphinTV
2015-10-01 03:41:35	ssbmstuff	I remember when I first bought Brawl on release night, went home and I think the first thing I tried to do was wavedash with Pit... heard (obviously) it was removed, but it was one of those silly things I didn't believe till I saw for myself
2015-10-01 03:41:45	sleepyk	dude same :(
2015-10-01 03:42:02	sleepyk	good ol 3 am f5 parties
2015-10-01 03:42:31	gull_ssbm	I wonder if players will start pressing L/R while throwing out aerials at high % just incase they get swatted out of the air, kind of like an option select
2015-10-01 03:42:34	neckrosh	Sig plays so toxic, just hugging the ledge 24/7 ***

2015-10-01 03:43:28	sleepyk	fsmashing a fully invincible shino stall is the best way
2015-10-01 03:43:39	sleepyk	to ensure u get hit
2015-10-01 03:43:40	caysekong	wow he got a fsmash

2015-10-01 19:34:54	frugtkurv	are you using an emulator?
2015-10-01 19:35:37	meloric	You need to use dolphin emulator for netplay @frugtkurv
2015-10-01 19:35:52	meloric	Alexander do you have netplay?
2015-10-01 19:36:24	frugtkurv	i do too but when i play melee i seem to lag even though im running 50 fps
2015-10-01 19:36:25	frugtkurv	wat do
2015-10-01 19:37:06	kalam1ty	is it only when you're playing online? if so, it's probably because you're setting the buffer too lower.
2015-10-01 19:37:08	kalam1ty	loe*
2015-10-01 19:37:10	kalam1ty	alsdk
2015-10-01 19:37:23	kalam1ty	melee should be very easy to run.
2015-10-01 19:37:29	frugtkurv	nah its offline. i have only tried offline
2015-10-01 19:37:56	kalam1ty	and you don't have the fps capped in the settings either? Should be set to auto or 60
2015-10-01 19:38:21	meloric	Maybe your rig just sucks honestly
2015-10-01 19:38:21	miracletea	hi sig

2015-10-01 19:45:52	kalam1ty	don't use the latest dev build if that's what you're using. use the build that people on SL have deemed as 'stable'.

2015-10-01 19:46:47	kalam1ty	if you happened to just have downloaded one of the latest dev buidls, you may be downloaded one that was broken (since they're.. well, dev builds).

2015-10-01 20:38:42	jayrows	I hate playing as marth, idk why. Falco's a baller though.

2015-10-01 20:40:03	bravo_1000	Sig's Fox is too technical for this stream. The sheer number of shines would probably crack all of our screens.
2015-10-01 20:40:12	karstenc	lolol
2015-10-01 20:40:22	rinku249	i believe on the fox
2015-10-01 20:40:51	bravo_1000	I money matched his Fox once. With Link, at Tipped Off X. Got shined blind.

2015-10-01 20:46:53	rinku249	DK Kreygasm
2015-10-01 20:47:04	theotherguy20	I've been hooked on watching kazio speed runs with TAS

2015-10-01 20:57:54	jayrows	but he's so much fun
2015-10-01 20:58:05	bravo_1000	He's less fun when you're Link.
2015-10-01 20:58:06	rinku249	bravo captain falcon is best character no exceptions
2015-10-01 20:58:13	umbrecensor	is this netplay?
2015-10-01 20:58:17	bravo_1000	Air wobble into rest, man. Air wobble into rest.
2015-10-01 20:58:50	jayrows	I feel like Melee in general is less fun when you're Link Kappa
2015-10-01 20:58:53	theotherguy20	KO
2015-10-01 20:59:29	rinku249	it is pretty funny to play as link, his sound files are kind hilarious
2015-10-01 20:59:37	jayrows	my brother would use link in the 64 days, even then I knew.
2015-10-01 20:59:40	siglemic	dk's punishes seem interesting
2015-10-01 20:59:43	siglemic	i just don't really know them
2015-10-01 20:59:58	rinku249	sig play captain plz
2015-10-01 21:00:01	umbrecensor	how serious of a smash player do you aim to be?
2015-10-01 21:00:02	theotherguy20	HES SPEAKS <3
2015-10-01 21:00:12	rinku249	:(
2015-10-01 21:00:20	jayrows	He wants to be as serious as m2k and leffen combined
2015-10-01 21:00:20	bravo_1000	He's great against spaceys. He can chaingrab them until the point where long up air strings happen.
2015-10-01 21:00:22	rinku249	dk is a great character
2015-10-01 21:00:27	theotherguy20	Yea captain plz
2015-10-01 21:00:28	coinbop64	Dk's punishes are amazing
2015-10-01 21:00:48	bravo_1000	Green Ranger was in my old region.
2015-10-01 21:00:54	rinku249	i like that dk has an easy suicide stock on this map
2015-10-01 21:01:15	coinbop64	where was green ranger?
2015-10-01 21:01:29	bravo_1000	Pittsburgh. Before he moved to New York.
2015-10-01 21:01:46	coinbop64	cool
2015-10-01 21:01:55	jayrows	Does Pittsburgh have a good scene?
2015-10-01 21:01:55	rinku249	when will this falco learn to not always side b
2015-10-01 21:02:20	theotherguy20	@rinku249 captain or dk?
2015-10-01 21:02:22	bravo_1000	Yeah it does. Even had a good Link main I could learn from.
2015-10-01 21:02:43	jayrows	I happen to live in basically the only dead part of FL
2015-10-01 21:02:56	rinku249	@Theotherguy20 i personally like more dk, but captain build so much hype
2015-10-01 21:03:04	rinku249	builds*
2015-10-01 21:03:07	theotherguy20	True^
2015-10-01 21:03:15	coinbop64	i don't much about link. what is his strats to win?
2015-10-01 21:03:28	rinku249	dont miss grabs, that the only condition
2015-10-01 21:03:40	bravo_1000	I'm in Georgia now, maybe I'll see you at Smash the Record!
2015-10-01 21:03:57	coinbop64	isn't his grab slow?
2015-10-01 21:04:13	jayrows	I was in GA last week, literally just moved back after 4 months
2015-10-01 21:04:17	rinku249	and it has a lot of ending lag, thats why you must not miss it
2015-10-01 21:04:20	bravo_1000	And Link revolves around punishing really hard with the few openings he gets in neutral.
2015-10-01 21:04:32	bravo_1000	He's so slow, but his combos are very damaging.
2015-10-01 21:04:36	coinbop64	thanks bravo
2015-10-01 21:04:39	bravo_1000	Not having a real grab sux.
2015-10-01 21:04:43	rinku249	bomb combos are also very important
2015-10-01 21:05:03	grandcathedral	hihi :D
2015-10-01 21:05:09	bravo_1000	Bomb is what you have instead of a neutral game.
2015-10-01 21:05:14	theotherguy20	@grandcathedral welcome
2015-10-01 21:05:48	rinku249	hello Kappa /
2015-10-01 21:05:49	bravo_1000	Oh hey there you go! That's how DK punishes.
2015-10-01 21:05:53	klaunderhaus	4 stk?
2015-10-01 21:06:10	coinbop64	so is young link better or worse?
2015-10-01 21:06:24	rinku249	better, but lacks killing power link has
2015-10-01 21:06:40	bravo_1000	Probably better. He has slightly better matchups against most top tiers, which is what counts these days.
2015-10-01 21:06:44	bravo_1000	And he's fast.
2015-10-01 21:06:53	rinku249	and has a way better neutral game
2015-10-01 21:06:54	klaunderhaus	No DI....
2015-10-01 21:07:00	starvingbox	that Falco is terrible
2015-10-01 21:07:00	alex9675	yl is kind of viable actually
2015-10-01 21:07:06	bravo_1000	I agree.
2015-10-01 21:07:32	coinbop64	why does fighting him?
2015-10-01 21:08:27	tmr69	i think i just played 6 hours of netplay, my hands will probably fall off soon
2015-10-01 21:08:38	simnaibnsind	Did You Know?: When a character breaks free from DK's cargo hold, both DK and the grabbed character take damage.
2015-10-01 21:08:38	rinku249	what is netplay?
2015-10-01 21:08:48	simnaibnsind	netplay is online play
2015-10-01 21:08:53	tmr69	netplay = using emulator to play melee online
2015-10-01 21:08:59	rinku249	oh

2015-10-01 21:33:28	rinku249	is it easy to get lag on netplay?
2015-10-01 21:33:48	tmr69	depends on distants of players between each other
2015-10-01 21:34:06	silverhand7	very distance dependent, but if you have decent internet it can be very playable
2015-10-01 21:34:12	tmr69	distance*
2015-10-01 21:34:32	brendooy	this ness is soooo good wtf
2015-10-01 21:34:32	rinku249	how do you get the gamecube controller to work?, wiiu adaptor?
2015-10-01 21:34:33	vwbusguy	Siglemic!
2015-10-01 21:34:50	improveurgame	yeah @Rinku249

2015-10-01 21:35:13	falconkneebrah	nice edgeguard dumbass
2015-10-01 21:35:15	parmsib	Well there are other adaptors, like the Mayflash one
2015-10-01 21:35:17	falconkneebrah	lmao
2015-10-01 21:35:19	rinku249	oh
2015-10-01 21:35:20	parmsib	but it has some inherent lag I think
2015-10-01 21:35:21	ni4gra	no way ness player is having fun right now
2015-10-01 21:35:37	rinku249	sorry for the questions, i may start playing netplay
2015-10-01 21:35:39	silverhand7	wii u adapter is best for netplay, since it has native support in dolphin
2015-10-01 21:35:45	parmsib	More players = more good :)
2015-10-01 21:36:02	nutstomp	>taunting

2015-10-01 21:36:36	nutstomp	this ness fell apart
2015-10-01 21:36:46	parmsib	Huw many frames of buffer do you muricans usually have to play with over netplay?
2015-10-01 21:36:52	thewhowhat	2
2015-10-01 21:37:03	falconkneebrah	netplay is aids
2015-10-01 21:37:08	simnaibnsind	@Siglemic, that upsmash right there was cool
2015-10-01 21:37:11	silverhand7	I live in a less populated area netplay-wise, usually 5-6 buffer for me
2015-10-01 21:37:32	rinku249	?
2015-10-01 21:37:32	parmsib	Ah ok
2015-10-01 21:37:40	parmsib	Im in Sweden, playing swedes
2015-10-01 21:37:45	parmsib	Usually nothing more than 2 frames
2015-10-01 21:37:48	falconkneebrah	stay away from netplay unless you live in somalia or something
2015-10-01 21:37:58	vwbusguy	is sig fox or nes?
2015-10-01 21:38:01	pwbluesky	fox
2015-10-01 21:38:08	falconkneebrah	there's going to be someone around you who plays melee
2015-10-01 21:38:29	rinku249	that bair tho
2015-10-01 21:38:33	tmr69	i get 5 frames to the swedes :(
2015-10-01 21:38:40	nutstomp	the comeback
2015-10-01 21:38:44	siglemic	oh the empty land one
2015-10-01 21:38:47	parmsib	Honestly the only thing I really notice a difference with between netplay and a normal setup is waveland timing
2015-10-01 21:38:59	theryer	omfg the walk up up smash
2015-10-01 21:39:03	kidikorus	Melee has online play?
2015-10-01 21:39:07	datsieghart	that was run up tho
2015-10-01 21:39:07	thewhowhat	yes
2015-10-01 21:39:09	falconkneebrah	netplay is really really bad
2015-10-01 21:39:15	pwbluesky	nah lol
2015-10-01 21:39:16	silverhand7	@Kidikorus, netplay over emulator
2015-10-01 21:39:18	kidikorus	Or is this rom?
2015-10-01 21:39:19	thewhowhat	netplay creates bad habits
2015-10-01 21:39:21	pwbluesky	netplay is pretty good
2015-10-01 21:39:23	kidikorus	Oh, thats what i thought.
2015-10-01 21:39:23	thewhowhat	I wouldnt reccomend it
2015-10-01 21:39:24	rinku249	yes gamecube was ahead of its time Kappa
2015-10-01 21:39:36	falconkneebrah	online for any fighting game is like a whole different game than offline
2015-10-01 21:39:40	falconkneebrah	trust me
2015-10-01 21:39:43	thewhowhat	unless u have nobidy to play again
2015-10-01 21:39:52	thewhowhat	Not true for killer intinct
2015-10-01 21:39:58	thewhowhat	the net code there is too godlike
2015-10-01 21:40:02	vwbusguy	actually gc had an eth addon
2015-10-01 21:40:11	falconkneebrah	no one plays that so it doesn't matter
2015-10-01 21:40:12	nycicon	can I netpray next?
2015-10-01 21:40:18	thewhowhat	Nah people play it
2015-10-01 21:40:18	silverhand7	Net code for dolphin is actually pretty good
2015-10-01 21:40:20	kidikorus	Anything with ggpo netcode is legit thou.
2015-10-01 21:40:22	kidikorus	mvc2
2015-10-01 21:40:24	kidikorus	sf3
2015-10-01 21:40:42	thewhowhat	just they waiting for the next season DUMMIE
2015-10-01 21:41:10	falconkneebrah	fightcade sf3 runs at a different speed compared to arcades
2015-10-01 21:41:15	custardcone	rip 4 stocking
2015-10-01 21:41:16	rinku249	lol that upsmash
2015-10-01 21:41:21	theryer	upsmash god
2015-10-01 21:41:34	tmr69	so does super turbo but no one gives a fuck, they just practise offline when they need to
2015-10-01 21:41:37	tmr69	stop being an ass falconknee
2015-10-01 21:41:42	falconkneebrah	even ignoring the connection issues the mentality of sitting next to someone and playing them it completely different
2015-10-01 21:41:50	bravo_1000	How does Ness ever get back to the stage?
2015-10-01 21:41:54	falconkneebrah	@TMR69 I'm telling the truth
2015-10-01 21:41:59	silverhand7	lol, sitting next to someone doesn't affect your play
2015-10-01 21:42:07	falconkneebrah	bull fucking shit
2015-10-01 21:42:11	theryer	LOL
2015-10-01 21:42:15	custardcone	lolol
2015-10-01 21:42:16	falconkneebrah	rip
2015-10-01 21:42:26	thewhowhat	theres more pressure for sure
2015-10-01 21:42:35	thewhowhat	theres this thing called nerves
2015-10-01 21:42:42	falconkneebrah	it makes you actually respect who you're playing
2015-10-01 21:42:46	thewhowhat	and sometimes u cant control it
2015-10-01 21:42:52	tmr69	i'd rather trust the top st players in eu that go tournies over a random about whether i should netplay or not
2015-10-01 21:42:54	bravo_1000	You can get nerves in online games.
2015-10-01 21:42:54	falconkneebrah	and realize that they're a thinking person
2015-10-01 21:43:12	bravo_1000	Never played Melee netplay, but CSGO is hard.
2015-10-01 21:43:25	thewhowhat	we are talking about fighting games
2015-10-01 21:43:26	custardcone	rip 4 stocking

2015-10-01 21:44:01	siglemic	ya
2015-10-01 21:44:11	falconkneebrah	anyone who just netplays is the legit definition of a random lmao
2015-10-01 21:44:26	simnaibnsind	oh
2015-10-01 21:44:29	bravo_1000	I hate netplay hate.
2015-10-01 21:44:31	simnaibnsind	the whole stream ended
2015-10-01 21:44:39	siglemic	yea been playin for a few hours
2015-10-01 21:44:39	falconkneebrah	darkness
2015-10-01 21:44:44	simnaibnsind	ah ok
2015-10-01 21:44:47	custardcone	death
2015-10-01 21:44:47	parmsib	inprisoning me
2015-10-01 21:44:49	bravo_1000	Simna your Ness was just too dirty.
2015-10-01 21:44:56	bravo_1000	None of the viewers could handle it.
2015-10-01 21:44:58	simnaibnsind	bravo i hope thats good
2015-10-01 21:45:01	simnaibnsind	hahahaha
2015-10-01 21:45:07	custardcone	it was a good ness
2015-10-01 21:45:12	simnaibnsind	^_____^
2015-10-01 21:45:17	parmsib	dem pk thinder gimps :)
2015-10-01 21:45:41	simnaibnsind	dont judge us too harshly/////i just woke up and came in here and sig doesnt know the matchup
2015-10-01 21:45:58	miracletea	ggs
2015-10-01 21:46:04	parmsib	Looks like he learned it :)
2015-10-01 21:46:06	siglemic	doesn't seem like ness can do much about lasering
2015-10-01 21:46:14	siglemic	on fd/large stage
2015-10-01 21:46:25	simnaibnsind	he cant.....ness has to come to terms with getting hit by lasers and not go on tolt because of it
2015-10-01 21:46:31	simnaibnsind	on tilt*
2015-10-01 21:46:33	tmr69	i thought grabbing more/dash dancing harder seems better than lasers
2015-10-01 21:46:52	simnaibnsind	it is true tho that fox can beat ness just fine without lasers
2015-10-01 21:47:01	simnaibnsind	he has his options
2015-10-01 21:47:04	simnaibnsind	hahahaha
2015-10-01 21:47:38	siglemic	ness can't seem to approach, he has his baits, like the double jump fair/stomp stuff or WD back
2015-10-01 21:47:44	tmr69	that sounds generic but it just looked like simna was doing djc/tilt shenanigans and hoping you'd run into it
2015-10-01 21:48:53	simnaibnsind	Nes has actually approaches with decent range, but his "safest" approaches suffer from being CCable for a while....so his choices are: approach and get CC punished or approach with a non CCable but low range move
2015-10-01 21:49:12	simnaibnsind	of course.....its easier when he plays against someone who cant force him to approach
2015-10-01 21:49:19	siglemic	oh yeah dash attack was alright
2015-10-01 21:49:20	simnaibnsind	but you gotta deal with it
2015-10-01 21:49:36	simnaibnsind	yeah dash attack is cool when i get you past cc %
2015-10-01 21:49:47	simnaibnsind	(or try to throw it out when i think you'll fail to cc)
2015-10-01 21:50:10	siglemic	is dash attk multi hit?
2015-10-01 21:50:15	siglemic	like is the first hit easier to cc
2015-10-01 21:50:20	simnaibnsind	can I post a link in here?
2015-10-01 21:50:23	siglemic	ye
2015-10-01 21:50:33	simnaibnsind	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcHIezTR5X8
2015-10-01 21:50:53	simnaibnsind	I just made that video a few days ago
2015-10-01 21:51:29	siglemic	so cc shine just owns for the first 2 hits
2015-10-01 21:53:06	simnaibnsind	or CC upsash
2015-10-01 21:53:08	simnaibnsind	upsmash*
2015-10-01 21:53:18	siglemic	dang cool
2015-10-01 21:53:35	siglemic	is uthrow uair real on ness
2015-10-01 21:53:44	simnaibnsind	to a certain %
2015-10-01 21:53:52	siglemic	looks to work early
2015-10-01 21:53:57	simnaibnsind	it does work early
2015-10-01 21:54:00	siglemic	but not death %
2015-10-01 21:54:03	simnaibnsind	but it eventually ends
2015-10-01 21:54:06	simnaibnsind	oh
2015-10-01 21:54:29	simnaibnsind	i can DI it before it can kill me, but it still makes me feel like im gonna die if I DI it or not ^___^
2015-10-01 21:54:34	simnaibnsind	hahahaha
2015-10-01 21:54:35	siglemic	lol
2015-10-01 21:54:42	nitecyper	Nice video, Simna.
2015-10-01 21:54:45	simnaibnsind	hey thanks
2015-10-01 21:56:41	simnaibnsind	@Siglemic, you still here? Does your viewer count usually sit around the 80-90 area?
2015-10-01 21:56:49	siglemic	umm
2015-10-01 21:56:53	siglemic	when i do netplay yeah
2015-10-01 21:56:56	simnaibnsind	oh ok
2015-10-01 21:57:12	siglemic	it's a bit higher when i'm doing some kind of gaming
2015-10-01 21:57:22	siglemic	and then way higher if i'm doing speedruns
2015-10-01 21:57:28	simnaibnsind	i need to stream more so ppl know i stream.....i usually sit at 10-15 suring my streams
2015-10-01 21:57:38	simnaibnsind	netplay streams
2015-10-01 21:57:43	simnaibnsind	during*
2015-10-01 21:57:51	siglemic	pretty much the only ppl who would wanna watch netplay
2015-10-01 21:57:56	siglemic	are really really into melee
2015-10-01 21:58:46	simnaibnsind	Dang.....so you're saying I should stream league just to advertise then go back to melee? ^___^
2015-10-01 21:58:46	siglemic	ill host u @ some point if im not streaming just let me know
2015-10-01 21:58:52	simnaibnsind	oh cool
2015-10-01 21:59:05	simnaibnsind	i usually end up streaming on tue or wed
2015-10-01 21:59:12	simnaibnsind	only once a week right now
2015-10-01 21:59:28	siglemic	ah.. yeah. do you ever have ppl over to play in norcal
2015-10-01 21:59:49	simnaibnsind	not really....i usually play with my spouse and on netplay
2015-10-01 22:00:06	siglemic	ic. mostly retired from locals?
2015-10-01 22:00:20	simnaibnsind	not by choice....i would go, but im intensely poor
2015-10-01 22:00:28	siglemic	ah lol
2015-10-01 22:00:47	simnaibnsind	like a $10 expense is inexcusable
2015-10-01 22:01:06	simnaibnsind	kinda why i started streaming
2015-10-01 22:01:11	siglemic	what's up with your stock icons
2015-10-01 22:01:14	simnaibnsind	so i could get some extra money to actually be at tournaments
2015-10-01 22:01:24	simnaibnsind	oh....its a texture hack.....they are PK Thunders
2015-10-01 22:01:41	siglemic	if you're gonna play no reason not to stream it
2015-10-01 22:01:42	simnaibnsind	like a few weeks ago i got enough donations to go to a Foundry....that was pretty nice
2015-10-01 22:01:58	siglemic	do ppl ever get salty about ness when u go to tourneys
2015-10-01 22:02:37	simnaibnsind	not locally at this point.....i havent been the best in my area for a few years, but i was at one point and taught nearly everyone in the area how to play
2015-10-01 22:02:48	simnaibnsind	that is....my area of norcal...not norcal entirely
2015-10-01 22:03:04	simnaibnsind	i usually have to play outside norcal for ppl to get upset
2015-10-01 22:03:11	simnaibnsind	but even then it doesnt show up too much
2015-10-01 22:03:21	siglemic	lol
2015-10-01 22:03:28	simnaibnsind	actually.....most of that kinda saltiness i've run into on smashladder
2015-10-01 22:03:42	simnaibnsind	one guy outright quit a ranked game when he saw me select ness.....before we even played
2015-10-01 22:04:31	simnaibnsind	but ya know.....better to lose the match on smashladder and know how it goes than make your first experience in a tournament where you are actually a good player who doesnt know whats going on
2015-10-01 22:04:49	simnaibnsind	i know ppl dont like that......but they gotta stop treating matchups like they are worthless
2015-10-01 22:05:45	siglemic	yeah i lost to a yoshi who's pretty good in tourney last week

2015-10-03 02:28:16	vappygo	It's definitely improved over the years
2015-10-03 02:28:38	potatoesofdeath	depends on proximity. latency is bad at time.
2015-10-03 02:28:44	majora_mask123	so its worth buying a gamecuve to pc controller and playing if you like melee
2015-10-03 02:28:44	siglemic	netplay just needs good players now
2015-10-03 02:29:10	vappygo	^
2015-10-03 02:29:30	siglemic	i legit don't feel challenged by almost any netplayer, and i'm not good at the game

2015-10-04 23:44:18	maragor	Bleh, I hate that Armarda won. -.-
2015-10-04 23:44:22	1pop2	His tech is pretty good, but he's gotta tighten up a lil on the neutral
2015-10-04 23:44:34	veklion	better than campy box winning

2015-10-04 23:44:49	1pop2	I like armada tbh
2015-10-04 23:44:55	xhoshikox	People cheering for laser camping instead ***
2015-10-04 23:44:57	hot_dogg	hes been playing melee mainly for a while now
2015-10-04 23:44:59	maragor	His hair and face looked so greasy. Like he had never heard of a shower.
2015-10-04 23:45:00	joshxgenesis	The lemic
2015-10-04 23:45:13	1pop2	I like all of the top 5 ( leffen is scrub)
2015-10-04 23:45:20	benjammy	@Nubetatester yknow what i mean tho, like is he dropping SR for melee?
2015-10-04 23:45:26	xhoshikox	Leffen has not had a good year
2015-10-04 23:45:28	nubetatester	idk im not his keeper
2015-10-04 23:45:30	hot_dogg	i remember seeing sig's baby fox

2015-10-04 23:46:13	benjammy	hopefully sheiks meta will evolve
2015-10-04 23:46:16	nubetatester	reaction tech chasing, needles, long legs; idk why you wouldn't pick up sheik
2015-10-04 23:46:23	1pop2	The rolling habit is pretty ugly. I had one of those for a whilr
2015-10-04 23:46:26	broly4lyfe	rip hbox
2015-10-04 23:46:36	sentry_ahead	tbh5 gf ***
2015-10-04 23:47:11	benjammy	eh i feel like hbox always loses when he tries to be patient or campy
2015-10-04 23:47:27	okamirain	sheik very skilled player, marth not
2015-10-04 23:47:29	ipickflowers	this game moves so fast
2015-10-04 23:47:33	nubetatester	except when he's playing the goat
2015-10-04 23:47:47	nubetatester	turns out mango still can't figure out planking puff
2015-10-04 23:48:14	hot_dogg	lol roll into grab
2015-10-04 23:48:19	benjammy	yeah, i feel hbox was playing veeeery defensive against armada which kept giving him control ove rhim
2015-10-04 23:48:33	xhoshikox	Even then hbox showed that he can adapt his strategy to non-campy puff, at least in the grand finals
2015-10-04 23:49:44	benjammy	anyone live in IL?
2015-10-04 23:49:56	nubetatester	the ledgecamp strategy would be more effective if puff didn't get hit by every laser in existence

2015-10-05 00:08:17	xspilix	Didn't know Siglemic speed ran smash too Kappa
2015-10-05 00:09:35	mrfirestorm	that series made me sad
2015-10-05 00:09:56	lylelylecrocodile	I laughed so hard when they did the replay.

2015-10-05 00:14:45	cdawg025	What in tarnation?
2015-10-05 00:15:37	nubetatester	abate vs s2j was super cool and super sad FeelsBadMan
2015-10-05 00:16:22	scf3	rip abate
2015-10-05 00:16:32	bluecrystal004	i was sad
2015-10-05 00:16:53	scf3	me too
2015-10-05 00:16:54	bluecrystal004	but big house was crazy in general
2015-10-05 00:23:42	mrfirestorm	Rip abate more like rip sj2 FeelsBirthdayMan
2015-10-05 00:24:01	bluecrystal004	that was actual bs though
2015-10-05 00:24:18	mrfirestorm	Does missfire effect knockback?
2015-10-05 00:24:23	mrfirestorm	or what ever the move is called
2015-10-05 00:24:35	bluecrystal004	no, it was invisible ceiling i think
2015-10-05 00:24:46	mrfirestorm	thats odd
2015-10-05 00:26:03	daytowers	I just drank a glass of warm water.
2015-10-05 00:26:35	mrfirestorm	though with the ceiling glitch are people not normally hit downwards?
2015-10-05 00:27:07	bluecrystal004	so the theory i heard

2015-10-05 01:42:35	caysekong	something about it feels weird, old gamecube controllers didnt feel like that
2015-10-05 01:42:49	caivs	the components used for the triggers are diff
2015-10-05 01:42:50	dannon01	Whens Super Mario 64?
2015-10-05 01:43:21	caivs	some ppl take the old triggers and put em in white controllers or w/e
2015-10-05 01:43:24	wizmander	I feel like if you don't press them straight down
2015-10-05 01:43:26	caivs	the bar thing
2015-10-05 01:43:32	caysekong	ahh
2015-10-05 01:43:34	wizmander	you hit a weird resistance

2015-10-05 01:43:45	mcpally	How's it going Sig? Catch any of TBH5?
2015-10-05 01:43:54	boreh32	in my experience
2015-10-05 01:44:19	boreh32	but if you use it a lot it loosens up
2015-10-05 01:44:46	caysekong	i gave mine away rofl

2015-10-05 01:57:34	l4zer_inc	its interesting to see a few speedrunners getting into melee

2015-10-05 01:57:46	saintmillion	melee room at gdqs are pretty fun
2015-10-05 01:57:47	mntempest	pie aka lonejedi played smash long before speedrunning
2015-10-05 01:57:49	siglemic	yea how is that offensive lmfao
2015-10-05 01:57:49	iotku	flippy_o, I went into cloud stage without wingcam lamo
2015-10-05 01:57:57	iotku	*wingcap
2015-10-05 01:57:57	rayne_bro	i feel like most speedrunners played melee as boys
2015-10-05 01:58:03	benjammy	i think speedrunning is getting less popular
2015-10-05 01:58:04	flippy_o	which row/col did you do?
2015-10-05 01:58:04	rayne_bro	at least
2015-10-05 01:58:07	mntempest	well he was PR'd in wisconsin before speedrunning then
2015-10-05 01:58:08	iotku	col4
2015-10-05 01:58:13	caysekong	no offense sig but mango is really good at melee
2015-10-05 01:58:15	flippy_o	yeah toast did the same
2015-10-05 01:58:18	caysekong	rofl
2015-10-05 01:58:20	flippy_o	none of us saw col3 was so great

2015-10-05 01:58:23	rayne_bro	well I mean when it comes to speedrunning you can actually just run out of games
2015-10-05 01:58:26	saintmillion	no offense but I'm really bad at melee
2015-10-05 01:58:26	iotku	5 stars ddd, 2 100 coins and cannons
2015-10-05 01:58:28	benjammy	speedrunners trading speedrunning for melee
2015-10-05 01:58:33	iotku	DDD went better than expected
2015-10-05 01:58:35	benjammy	which i approve of either
2015-10-05 01:58:38	flippy_o	Wait Toast had col5 my b
2015-10-05 01:58:44	fizzedelf	nerds
2015-10-05 01:58:45	iotku	my thi100 is still pretty cancer
2015-10-05 01:58:47	iotku	gotta learn the rroute
2015-10-05 01:59:01	flippy_o	Not a lot of speedrunners go all in on melee though, it's more a dream I feel
2015-10-05 01:59:08	saintmillion	^
2015-10-05 01:59:17	flippy_o	learn best thi100 iotku, it's not too bad
2015-10-05 01:59:23	iotku	linky?
2015-10-05 01:59:24	fizzedelf	Lovage is a speedrunner
2015-10-05 01:59:25	saintmillion	When I'm not running I dick around in melee, but I never go hard on learning
2015-10-05 01:59:28	iotku	or is it on the guide?
2015-10-05 01:59:29	fizzedelf	and he won the first big house
2015-10-05 01:59:30	mntempest	rip lovage :(
2015-10-05 01:59:33	rayne_bro	i mean going all in on melee is devoting a shit ton of time to an old niche game lol
2015-10-05 01:59:34	iotku	I should probably look at it more....
2015-10-05 01:59:37	flippy_o	dunno about link, I guess it's on the guide
2015-10-05 01:59:38	mntempest	wish he would play melee again
2015-10-05 01:59:39	robobob408	i came here for dank memes, will anyone provide?
2015-10-05 01:59:43	iotku	probably is
2015-10-05 01:59:49	flippy_o	Otherwise I can run you through stuff if you add me on skype
2015-10-05 01:59:57	flippy_o	like, when I'm not sitting in class
2015-10-05 01:59:57	iotku	I'm trying to keep track of stuff I completely choke on
2015-10-05 02:00:04	iotku	and then once I get those sorted out learn good strats
2015-10-05 02:00:06	chessm64	Omg your playing with egg Kreygasm
2015-10-05 02:00:27	flippy_o	good strats should come before sorting out chokes tbh
2015-10-05 02:00:34	robobob408	nice joe flaco
2015-10-05 02:00:38	iotku	well I mean like
2015-10-05 02:00:51	iotku	I go to do the star and I don't have a clue where to even go hardly type stuff
2015-10-05 02:01:23	iotku	mostly just 100 coin routes I guess now
2015-10-05 02:01:27	iotku	which I should learn proper
2015-10-05 02:01:43	mntempest	sig idk if you care, but should mix in some nair approaches instead of always dair. nair has the exact same amount of shield stun, but is 2 frames less land lag if you L cancel it iirc. basically its safer if they shield.

2015-10-05 02:18:13	rainbowess	Yeah
2015-10-05 02:18:13	htothetml	there wasn't really a drought tho
2015-10-05 02:18:19	caivs	that seems trippy
2015-10-05 02:18:22	htothetml	just a lot of sun and a lack of rain
2015-10-05 02:18:25	htothetml	not that bad
2015-10-05 02:18:40	caivs	im in ca so i know a thing or two about droughts Kappa
2015-10-05 02:18:41	htothetml	i think the people who do the weather are so used to the frequently infrequent rain ***
2015-10-05 02:18:46	rainbowess	I like the post of the guy refusing to admit mew2king is an actual tournament threat.
2015-10-05 02:18:48	htothetml	@Caivs too soon
2015-10-05 02:18:55	rainbowess	And he just refuses to admit it
2015-10-05 02:19:04	wizmander	m2k'

2015-10-05 02:19:26	htothetml	the entire set vs hbox i was wondering why he was going fox
2015-10-05 02:19:30	htothetml	instead of marth
2015-10-05 02:19:34	naviheylistenwatchout	m2k is really smart but he gets stuck in his ways and chokes constantly
2015-10-05 02:19:34	htothetml	except on dreamland
2015-10-05 02:19:42	htothetml	i see why he didnt go marth on dreamland
2015-10-05 02:20:02	nubetatester	m2k going fox on fod vs armada got me worried
2015-10-05 02:20:03	wizmander	I feel like m2k either dumpsters people
2015-10-05 02:20:13	rainbowess	I don't play melee, it's a spectator eSport for me, I'm arthritic at the young age of 16 :(
2015-10-05 02:20:19	caysekong	m2k just beat mango tonight
2015-10-05 02:20:20	wizmander	or he does well
2015-10-05 02:20:27	wizmander	but can't hold on tough sets
2015-10-05 02:20:31	rainbowess	But I'm smart enough to realize m2k is a tournament threat lol
2015-10-05 02:20:41	htothetml	mango was really sad in the interview after the tourney with scar
2015-10-05 02:20:43	htothetml	like
2015-10-05 02:20:46	htothetml	depressed
2015-10-05 02:20:47	naviheylistenwatchout	can be* @Rainbowess
2015-10-05 02:20:50	rainbowess	I didn't stick around
2015-10-05 02:20:54	nubetatester	m2k is either top 8 or on twitter complaining about something
2015-10-05 02:20:55	wizmander	it's been a tough little bit for mang0
2015-10-05 02:20:56	caivs	the interviews were gdlk dude
2015-10-05 02:21:00	flippy_o	mango hasn't been practicing much lately though has he?
2015-10-05 02:21:03	caivs	like 45 mins of interbiews lol
2015-10-05 02:21:11	wizmander	m2k interview was funny
2015-10-05 02:21:13	wizmander	as per usual
2015-10-05 02:21:25	htothetml	although that one part where m2k came in and ripped the headset off of scar during mang0's interview was hilarious
2015-10-05 02:21:27	flippy_o	damn I gotta watch the interviews when I get home from school
2015-10-05 02:21:36	rainbowess	Did he talk about the Private Messaging game on stream
2015-10-05 02:21:36	nubetatester	m2k has all this knowledge but he doesn't know how to properly articulate it FeelsBadMan
2015-10-05 02:21:37	caivs	yeah the m2k one was too good
2015-10-05 02:21:38	htothetml	and then just threw stuff at him
2015-10-05 02:21:39	flippy_o	sucks the top 8 was so late in Europe I couldn't watch
2015-10-05 02:21:41	caysekong	someone said mango was retiring soon
2015-10-05 02:21:54	rainbowess	Mang0 said he was gonna retire on stream
2015-10-05 02:21:58	htothetml	@Caysekong someone is destroying my hopes and dreams ***
2015-10-05 02:21:58	wizmander	why would he retire, what else is he gonna do...
2015-10-05 02:22:04	caivs	stream
2015-10-05 02:22:05	naviheylistenwatchout	@Rainbowess, was he drunk?
2015-10-05 02:22:06	benjammy	mang0 cant retire
2015-10-05 02:22:07	rainbowess	And just stream
2015-10-05 02:22:08	wizmander	go to school?
2015-10-05 02:22:10	nubetatester	idk, the goat has had a good run
2015-10-05 02:22:11	htothetml	@Wizmander have a family?
2015-10-05 02:22:14	benjammy	what about the kid???
2015-10-05 02:22:27	caysekong	he has 1400 subs on twitch, im sure hes good for a while
2015-10-05 02:22:33	nubetatester	maybe he'll go to school and raise a family
2015-10-05 02:22:37	caivs	he gets way more money from twitch than tournies i think
2015-10-05 02:22:42	rainbowess	Navi, he might have been, but when isn't he.
2015-10-05 02:22:42	wizmander	Not trying to be rude, but I don't know if he has much else going for him, I don't know if he has any school done
2015-10-05 02:22:51	caysekong	that # is prob incorrect but y'know
2015-10-05 02:22:52	rainbowess	He has highschool done
2015-10-05 02:22:56	rainbowess	He's graduated
2015-10-05 02:23:03	rainbowess	He's talked about that on stream
2015-10-05 02:23:04	omniopal	barely
2015-10-05 02:23:10	naviheylistenwatchout	nah
2015-10-05 02:23:10	rainbowess	He got that D
2015-10-05 02:23:17	naviheylistenwatchout	long as melee is relevant mango will be around
2015-10-05 02:23:19	caivs	scar wont let him rot
2015-10-05 02:23:21	nubetatester	the goat def needs some higher education if he's retiring
2015-10-05 02:23:36	wizmander	it sounds like he's not really good at managing his money either
2015-10-05 02:23:42	wizmander	again, I'm not trying to diss on the kid
2015-10-05 02:23:44	rainbowess	He gambles
2015-10-05 02:23:48	wizmander	I just feel like melee is all he has
2015-10-05 02:23:58	rainbowess	But everytime he streams he makes like $1k
2015-10-05 02:24:06	rainbowess	Well
2015-10-05 02:24:14	rainbowess	Depends on how long
2015-10-05 02:24:16	rainbowess	He streams
2015-10-05 02:24:19	nubetatester	mango def makes 2.5 grand a month
2015-10-05 02:24:21	caysekong	he had an extra 1k to blow on leffen at apex he'll be fine
2015-10-05 02:24:33	naviheylistenwatchout	he's got a family, like he has a kid and a wife and he's got sponsor(s) plus a huge fanbase?
2015-10-05 02:24:39	rainbowess	Nube you're def underestimating stream income
2015-10-05 02:24:53	naviheylistenwatchout	to me that's more than melee, melee just happens to be the focus point for his fanbase
2015-10-05 02:25:06	nubetatester	he makes 2.50 a sub and he has over 1k subs
2015-10-05 02:25:09	nubetatester	cirPrise
2015-10-05 02:25:23	naviheylistenwatchout	^ that emote so qt tho
2015-10-05 02:25:27	rainbowess	Most streamers get most of their money from donations cirPrise Kappa
2015-10-05 02:26:18	flippy_o	yea donation is main source of money for most, because people with a lot of money just donates a lot for whatever reason
2015-10-05 02:26:23	rainbowess	And the percentage of sub money he gets depends on the contract he has with twitch it varies with each streamer
2015-10-05 02:26:25	nubetatester	hey sig do you make money from donations?
2015-10-05 02:26:27	naviheylistenwatchout	all these songs tho they got me up in my feels
2015-10-05 02:26:33	wizmander	btw, I meant from a financial standpoint
2015-10-05 02:26:59	wizmander	idk maybe he can be one of those retired esports pros making a living in streaming
2015-10-05 02:27:00	daifukuu	HI SIGLEMIC !
2015-10-05 02:27:08	daifukuu	swolfGoofy
2015-10-05 02:27:09	caivs	not to mention commentary gigs
2015-10-05 02:27:14	naviheylistenwatchout	People like mangos personality....
2015-10-05 02:27:23	naviheylistenwatchout	he's got more than melee, case closed lol
2015-10-05 02:27:25	brubster	thnx for the gr8 stream biinny, good night
2015-10-05 02:27:28	wizmander	his commentary on anybody playing fox/falco
2015-10-05 02:27:31	naviheylistenwatchout	he could stream dota and pull 2k viewers
2015-10-05 02:27:32	wizmander	is Kreygasm
2015-10-05 02:27:41	rainbowess	He gets like 2k people watching his stream minimum if he plays melee 500 for anything else
2015-10-05 02:28:01	rainbowess	Csgo gets
2015-10-05 02:28:05	rainbowess	Like 1k as well
2015-10-05 02:28:08	siglemic	hey daifukuu
2015-10-05 02:28:08	wizmander	I guess the question is how many views can he pull if he's not playing competitively anymore, esp 2-3 years out.
2015-10-05 02:28:10	nubetatester	if only ppmd streamed more than once a year FeelsBadMan
2015-10-05 02:28:30	daifukuu	Otto says hi as well ^_^
2015-10-05 02:28:38	rainbowess	But if he retired he'd definitely stream more consistently on a schedule, he'd have to, and doing that with his fan base already would go up
2015-10-05 02:28:46	rainbowess	He'd still remain a c9 featured streamer
2015-10-05 02:29:12	naviheylistenwatchout	mango will always be relevant but maybe not by the crimsonblurs standards ***
2015-10-05 02:29:33	naviheylistenwatchout	yeah i agree
2015-10-05 02:29:35	wizmander	btw
2015-10-05 02:29:44	wizmander	anybody else think Vish really fun to listen to on the mic?
2015-10-05 02:29:46	nubetatester	i mean, the goat has a documentary, a sponsor, a nation, a family that loves him

2015-10-05 02:30:12	rainbowess	It's like mew2king, complaining about his hands and not being able to stream melee, he still pulls like 1k viewers when he streams not melee because his awkward interactions are funny af
2015-10-05 02:30:33	rainbowess	And cuz he's m2k
2015-10-05 02:30:43	nubetatester	i love watching m2k talk about melee in a casual environment

2015-10-05 22:18:09	kiburedokibu	I was actually thinking, would going pure locked range be bad? Because when you die...You'll just lose your arrows.
2015-10-05 22:18:18	emik115	Fox is love fox is life
2015-10-05 22:18:19	kiburedokibu	Same with magic.

2015-10-05 22:20:00	kiburedokibu	Hmm...
2015-10-05 22:20:16	kiburedokibu	Thinking... would it be a bad idea to just drop range?
2015-10-05 22:20:17	krusterbusterr	Hi sig!
2015-10-05 22:20:18	kiburedokibu	Er not range

2015-10-05 22:22:09	kiburedokibu	Prayer counts as combat though right? So I guess when you die you're shit out of attacking for awhile. :P
2015-10-05 22:22:11	siglemic	u know that means runemaster
2015-10-05 22:22:35	kiburedokibu	Was thinking about my non-combat as well.
2015-10-05 22:22:39	firemanzz	runeminer
2015-10-05 22:22:40	kiburedokibu	Locking agility, of course...

2015-10-05 22:44:43	mrwhatguy	I would play for gains on runescape as well. I don't care much for the quest or PVP
2015-10-05 22:44:52	whisperkick	like*
2015-10-05 22:45:08	leechy9	You know what I miss the most about RS back in the day? The noobs. There aren't noobs on 07, because everyone is so dedicated.
2015-10-05 22:45:20	pokemario21	whats the point of the second level in the motherlode mine?
2015-10-05 22:45:20	leechy9	I miss walking around like I'm the shit.
2015-10-05 22:45:22	siglemic	there's some noobs
2015-10-05 22:45:33	siglemic	but experienced ppl are more common
2015-10-05 22:45:33	whisperkick	i request you play the adventure
2015-10-05 22:45:35	kiburedokibu	I don't know, I still find some lower levels who don't know what they're doing, and need help
2015-10-05 22:45:38	siglemic	noobs are cute
2015-10-05 22:45:40	kiburedokibu	They're adorable. :P
2015-10-05 22:45:42	kiburedokibu	Shut up sig.
2015-10-05 22:45:56	optimusprimerib123z	sig have you completely the fally diary for a higher chance at better ores?
2015-10-05 22:45:58	kiburedokibu	Lmao
2015-10-05 22:46:01	pokemario21	whats the point of the second level in the motherlode mine?
2015-10-05 22:46:07	siglemic	i'm 1 def so i can't do it optimus
2015-10-05 22:46:07	kiburedokibu	Faster gainz
2015-10-05 22:46:10	mrwhatguy	I bot before on runescape. LOL
2015-10-05 22:46:11	leechy9	Dude, the best was to equip your badass high-level members shit and go into a non-member's Varrock.
2015-10-05 22:46:16	ablaij	runescape Kreygasm
2015-10-05 22:46:28	leechy9	Scrubs didn't even know Barrows existed.
2015-10-05 22:46:33	pokemario21	people just keep passing by my comments...
2015-10-05 22:46:34	kiburedokibu	I think my brother botted on my account a few months ago on RS3 when I was about to hit 98 range, mrwhat, got me perma'd, lol
2015-10-05 22:46:41	mrwhatguy	triGropeR triGiggle triGropeL
2015-10-05 22:46:45	whisperkick	Dat AVA playlist
2015-10-05 22:46:54	winterdrumz	nice to see old rs again
2015-10-05 22:46:55	leechy9	Pokemario21, it's less crowded and closer to bank, I think.
2015-10-05 22:47:00	leechy9	I'm not a miner, though.
2015-10-05 22:47:11	winterdrumz	90 mining won't be that hard at this point
2015-10-05 22:47:12	pokemario21	ive never botted on any game but adventure quest worlds, never got caught and made some sick gainz
2015-10-05 22:47:13	kiburedokibu	Not a miner, but definitely a minor?
2015-10-05 22:47:20	pokemario21	@leechy9, thank you
2015-10-05 22:47:39	kiburedokibu	Oh you have 88 mining now, nice.
2015-10-05 22:47:48	leechy9	No, I'm no longer a target for pedophiles in this game anymore.
2015-10-05 22:48:41	leechy9	Just 3 more levels, then you'll be half-way there.
2015-10-05 22:48:52	siglemic	ye i'm a mining lord
2015-10-05 22:48:56	winterdrumz	is there anything new you can mine at 90?
2015-10-05 22:49:00	pokemario21	i just recently hit 92 fletching
2015-10-05 22:49:06	winterdrumz	i'm out of rs like for over 3 years now
2015-10-05 22:49:12	leechy9	I love how 92 is only halfway there.
2015-10-05 22:49:13	kiburedokibu	Rune is the highest at 85
2015-10-05 22:49:13	pokemario21	cant bring myself to do the next 6.5 million exp
2015-10-05 22:49:17	leechy9	It's so damn annoying.
2015-10-05 22:49:25	siglemic	fletching is easy my friend
2015-10-05 22:49:37	pokemario21	yeah, i could get it easy by the end of next week
2015-10-05 22:49:37	winterdrumz	is a joke tbh
2015-10-05 22:49:52	kiburedokibu	You know what's truly sad? I've NEVER had a 99, lol
2015-10-05 22:49:53	leechy9	Isn't thieving the worst to get 99 in?
2015-10-05 22:49:57	pokemario21	its just really boring and you make like 10k an hour profit when doing magic longs
2015-10-05 22:50:03	ablaij	thieving is actually the easiest lol
2015-10-05 22:50:04	kiburedokibu	You're forgetting runecrafting, Leechy.
2015-10-05 22:50:26	winterdrumz	i got 99 rc before effigies time :(
2015-10-05 22:50:29	optimusprimerib123z	runecrafting is the best
2015-10-05 22:50:30	leechy9	I thought thieving was awful because it was so active.
2015-10-05 22:50:33	pokemario21	the worst 99s are runecrafting and agility, then slayer but slayer is fun even tho its long.
2015-10-05 22:50:33	winterdrumz	in 2009 iirc
2015-10-05 22:50:47	leechy9	Can you still hire nat runners?
2015-10-05 22:50:49	siglemic	hmm what do i want to listen to
2015-10-05 22:50:51	jayrows	Slayer's not all that bad, I think mining's way worse for some reason
2015-10-05 22:50:52	pokemario21	firemaking is the worst overall 99 because its long and useless
2015-10-05 22:50:52	kiburedokibu	Weird people like Sig find agility fun. :P
2015-10-05 22:50:56	leechy9	It shouldn't be that hard to get 99 rc
2015-10-05 22:50:58	winterdrumz	i like it too
2015-10-05 22:51:00	jayrows	I mean agility, ofc slayer's not that bad
2015-10-05 22:51:07	winterdrumz	got 93 or something
2015-10-05 22:51:23	leechy9	F that facebook sound
2015-10-05 22:51:26	arels	it's never for me BibleThump
2015-10-05 22:51:30	kiburedokibu	I keep looking as if I have a message somewhere, ffs, lol
2015-10-05 22:51:30	leechy9	It keeps tricking me.
2015-10-05 22:51:40	3drew101	I dont even have facebook open and im looking for it
2015-10-05 22:51:41	jayrows	I don't know if I'll ever be motivated enough to get above 70 mining, I only have like 60 right now
2015-10-05 22:51:44	pokemario21	how the heck did you grind out the 250 hours for 99 agility
2015-10-05 22:51:52	gamings5	looks like someone is popular
2015-10-05 22:51:53	gamings5	Kappa
2015-10-05 22:51:55	kiburedokibu	Netflix+Youtube+otherstuff
2015-10-05 22:52:29	leechy9	How does it feel to know that 10 straight days of your life have been wasted?
2015-10-05 22:52:31	jayrows	I'm taking it that you're not much of a PvM'er, Sig?
2015-10-05 22:52:45	siglemic	10 straight days?
2015-10-05 22:52:52	leechy9	250 hours
2015-10-05 22:52:57	siglemic	oh
2015-10-05 22:52:59	siglemic	idk man
2015-10-05 22:53:02	siglemic	i'm 99 agility
2015-10-05 22:53:04	siglemic	so suck it
2015-10-05 22:53:10	pokemario21	well played
2015-10-05 22:53:12	jayrows	True
2015-10-05 22:53:22	leechy9	On your death bed, are you going to be proud of that cape?
2015-10-05 22:53:23	siglemic	more importantly
2015-10-05 22:53:28	xyqq	do you have to make a new character when playing OS? I'm trying to but it won't let me onto my current one
2015-10-05 22:53:29	pokemario21	i would be
2015-10-05 22:53:29	siglemic	how does it feel that you aren't 99 agil?
2015-10-05 22:53:31	jayrows	I would be
2015-10-05 22:53:31	leechy9	I sure as shit would screenshot and print out a photo
2015-10-05 22:53:34	leechy9	Keep it by your bed.
2015-10-05 22:53:38	kiburedokibu	You are such a damn downer, Leechy. :P
2015-10-05 22:53:44	pokemario21	lol
2015-10-05 22:53:47	leechy9	lol
2015-10-05 22:53:48	siglemic	on my death bed, i'm sure this sick acc will cross my mind tbh
2015-10-05 22:53:54	jayrows	I'd be less proud if I were on my death bed and didn't have 99 agility
2015-10-05 22:54:01	pokemario21	^
2015-10-05 22:54:04	kiburedokibu	"Man.... I had a good RS life..." -dead-
2015-10-05 22:54:18	leechy9	I'm not being a downer. I wasted so much time playing this damn game.
2015-10-05 22:54:22	optimusprimerib123z	what are you doing after the 90 mining
2015-10-05 22:54:24	pokemario21	if i were to ever bot runescape (which i wont) i would bot agility
2015-10-05 22:54:24	leechy9	I know the feels.
2015-10-05 22:54:25	ablaij	but your xp isnt 14000000 anymore T_T
2015-10-05 22:54:28	optimusprimerib123z	what will fill the gaping void
2015-10-05 22:54:30	kiburedokibu	Just because you find it a waste doesn't mean we do. :p
2015-10-05 22:54:35	siglemic	yea i'm gonna get 15m sometime
2015-10-05 22:54:43	siglemic	i had to get agil xp to do 55 slay
2015-10-05 22:54:55	jayrows	Everyone who "used to" play runescape always talks about what a waste of time it is
2015-10-05 22:55:06	leechy9	I think you missed the part where I said that I played it again this summer; that means I play it even though I know it's a waste.
2015-10-05 22:55:10	kiburedokibu	You can say that about pretty much playing anything. :P
2015-10-05 22:55:12	rabokutv	yoo sig
2015-10-05 22:55:32	pokemario21	all video games are a waste, but as someone once said, time you enjoy wasting is not time wasted.
2015-10-05 22:55:59	jayrows	I haven't played in like a month, I need to get back on it but every time I get on nobody in my clan is pvming so I don't feel like I should waste the money on a bond
2015-10-05 22:56:04	pokemario21	it was john lennon
2015-10-05 22:56:10	pokemario21	that quote was john lennon
2015-10-05 22:56:38	leechy9	On another note, who here thinks Hayley Williams is too damn cute?
2015-10-05 22:56:45	pokemario21	hayley williams?
2015-10-05 22:56:49	kiburedokibu	Yeah but when John Lennon met Yoko, I think we all agree THAT was a waste of time...
2015-10-05 22:56:55	kiburedokibu	:P
2015-10-05 22:56:56	siglemic	not a fan of her new look but i do like her
2015-10-05 22:57:11	leechy9	Lead singer of Paramore, Pokemario21
2015-10-05 22:57:11	jayrows	I just looked her up, she's pretty alright in some pictures
2015-10-05 22:57:16	pokemario21	right i knew that
2015-10-05 22:57:29	leechy9	I used the word "cute" instead of beautiful or gorgeous.
2015-10-05 22:57:35	pokemario21	since like 3 years ago im not as big of a fan of paramore
2015-10-05 22:57:38	mkspgti	last time i was here months ago sig was mining for days... feel like he hasnt stopped since :)
2015-10-05 22:57:39	leechy9	Gorgeous is Avril Lavigne.
2015-10-05 22:57:46	kiburedokibu	You're sick, Leechy.
2015-10-05 22:57:54	leechy9	sick?
2015-10-05 22:58:02	kiburedokibu	:P
2015-10-05 22:58:05	pokemario21	i think avril is adorable
2015-10-05 22:58:19	pokemario21	but who the hell names their daughter avril
2015-10-05 22:58:30	pokemario21	it doesnt sound like a real name
2015-10-05 22:58:30	adam9222	u
2015-10-05 22:58:36	leechy9	Canadians do.
2015-10-05 22:58:40	leechy9	Not even trolling.
2015-10-05 22:58:42	adam9222	gottem
2015-10-05 22:58:47	mkspgti	right avril is a bad name, but apple and north are good names Kappa
2015-10-05 22:58:50	sublme	90 mining speed run hype?
2015-10-05 22:59:00	jayrows	Well, they meant to name her April but her mom fucked up
2015-10-05 22:59:01	siglemic	tfw 90 mining will take 30 hours ;;;;;
2015-10-05 22:59:09	adam9222	you can do it sig.
2015-10-05 22:59:13	adam9222	Go for the dream.
2015-10-05 22:59:18	adam9222	The American Dream.
2015-10-05 22:59:21	adam9222	of 90 mining
2015-10-05 22:59:21	sublme	how much from 90-99?
2015-10-05 22:59:25	kiburedokibu	....still not as bad as when you were trying to get 85 mining... right?... Right??
2015-10-05 22:59:26	sublme	like another 200 hours?
2015-10-05 22:59:27	adam9222	5 years
2015-10-05 22:59:33	pokemario21	@mkspgti, yeah well michael jackson himself was also screwed up
2015-10-05 22:59:34	leechy9	Does anybody else try clicking the ore/tree/fishing spot again if you haven't gotten an item in like 30 seconds?
2015-10-05 22:59:35	siglemic	dunno it's probably about as bad
2015-10-05 22:59:36	sublme	92 is only half way to 99
2015-10-05 22:59:37	ablaij	you could do granite but no profit
2015-10-05 22:59:45	siglemic	once you hit 85, it slows down so bad
2015-10-05 22:59:53	kiburedokibu	I figured... RIP, lol
2015-10-05 22:59:57	sublme	always a bummer when you get 92 and youre like "yeah im getting close"
2015-10-05 23:00:00	truedemonzu	92-99 is same xp at 1-92
2015-10-05 23:00:01	sublme	then you remember its only half way
2015-10-05 23:00:06	pokemario21	why do you keep it on your stats and not your invent?
2015-10-05 23:00:12	jayrows	depends on what you're doing, Leechy. If it's Rune rocks you should just keep at it
2015-10-05 23:00:16	siglemic	well 92 isn't really half way because you mine faster at that point than you did at 50 60 70 etc
2015-10-05 23:00:24	sublme	thats true i suppose
2015-10-05 23:00:30	siglemic	90 is probably true half way
2015-10-05 23:00:35	truedemonzu	same amount of exp though
2015-10-05 23:00:37	kiburedokibu	Makes me fking sad that I'm 92 range working on 99 range on RS3... Oh well... at least RS3 is shit and is fast, lol
2015-10-05 23:00:40	pokemario21	thats why the second half is always easier
2015-10-05 23:00:52	mkspgti	@Pokemario21, i dont see the relevance...
2015-10-05 23:00:54	sublme	but you have agility cape! you can do anything
2015-10-05 23:01:02	jayrows	I got 99 range in Pre eoc years ago
2015-10-05 23:01:07	kiburedokibu	I think agility should even help you mine faster. :P
2015-10-05 23:01:10	pokemario21	@mkspgti, dont worry about it, its not important.
2015-10-05 23:01:10	jayrows	rip godlike account
2015-10-05 23:01:17	pokemario21	agility needs to do a lot more
2015-10-05 23:01:17	leechy9	Jayrows, was that before chins?
2015-10-05 23:01:27	jayrows	Hell no, chins all the way
2015-10-05 23:01:29	siglemic	glad i waited until this game came out to actually grind
2015-10-05 23:01:31	pokemario21	its so hard to train that it needs more rewards for doing so
2015-10-05 23:01:34	jayrows	well, not all the way.
2015-10-05 23:01:37	siglemic	rip every1 who grinded during real game

2015-10-05 23:02:00	mkspgti	@Pokemario21, i believe you mean michael jacksons kid... named blanket :P i didnt mention that one tho

2015-10-05 23:02:19	sublme	i did pest control for 99 ranged back in the day
2015-10-05 23:02:20	kiburedokibu	I got 80 fucking slayer in RS3...so fucking fast.
2015-10-05 23:02:23	leechy9	I never did slayer as a kid. Only enough for a quest or two.
2015-10-05 23:02:27	kiburedokibu	I'm still STRUGGLING to get 72 slayer.

2015-10-05 23:08:04	leechy9	Dude, I didn't realize how broken the ice spells are until I began playing again.
2015-10-05 23:08:12	leechy9	They're like 15 seconds of lockdown.
2015-10-05 23:08:20	leechy9	And a 2.5 second cast.
2015-10-05 23:08:21	siglemic	i actually wanna do some more rune mining when i hit 90

2015-10-05 23:09:03	leechy9	I did that recently to get start-up cash for my new account.
2015-10-05 23:09:05	sublme	yeah it was a hell of a grind
2015-10-05 23:09:12	leechy9	It wasn't bad. You get 200k as a noob and you can buy anything.
2015-10-05 23:09:13	kiburedokibu	Woodcutting is always my startup skill
2015-10-05 23:09:21	sublme	but back then camelot was packed, tons of people trading at the bank
2015-10-05 23:09:24	juiceeverywhere	2005 i killed 10k dust devils for chain. even skipped some school
2015-10-05 23:09:27	leechy9	I did an account where I killed blue drags for money.
2015-10-05 23:09:36	sublme	so i could sell my strings without ever leaving Seers

2015-10-05 23:10:16	leechy9	Then walk back to rogue den
2015-10-05 23:10:30	sublme	game neck
2015-10-05 23:10:31	leechy9	There are no pures in Hero's Guild
2015-10-05 23:10:40	leechy9	Which means it's actually pretty empty
2015-10-05 23:10:42	sublme	but yeah 70 agility with a cannon at blues
2015-10-05 23:10:47	leechy9	Ah, okay

2015-10-05 23:11:35	siglemic	might do some agility on my alt while i do this
2015-10-05 23:11:44	sublme	greens are insanely profitable currently though
2015-10-05 23:11:45	kiburedokibu	Side by side streamz? :P

2015-10-05 23:12:55	kuhls	good music
2015-10-05 23:14:28	kiburedokibu	I'm hoping Deadman drops on the 8th, because that's apparently update day... but I doubt it.
2015-10-05 23:14:30	sublme	Sig you plan on doing quest cape?
2015-10-05 23:14:43	kiburedokibu	That's impossible, lol.

2015-10-05 23:15:05	sublme	theyre short and something different for a change
2015-10-05 23:15:06	kiburedokibu	I like them too, I just hate Regicide.
2015-10-05 23:15:07	ablaij	thats like asking if he's hype for monkey madness 2 lol
2015-10-05 23:15:17	kiburedokibu	The entire fucking regicide chain...
2015-10-05 23:15:20	sublme	and for how fast they are you get a nice reward most the time
2015-10-05 23:15:31	sublme	bruh, Darkness of Hallowvale
2015-10-05 23:15:35	leechy9	Dude, I did all the way through roving elves this summer
2015-10-05 23:15:37	sublme	fuck that quest
2015-10-05 23:15:53	sublme	i like the elf quests
2015-10-05 23:16:01	sublme	but i always have high agility for them
2015-10-05 23:16:03	kiburedokibu	A novice short quest in RS3 kicked my ass...
2015-10-05 23:16:09	kiburedokibu	Because of the balancing bosses...
2015-10-05 23:16:19	sublme	didnt play rs3 but right before rs3 i did Nomads Requiem
2015-10-05 23:16:22	sublme	that quest kicked my ass
2015-10-05 23:16:25	sublme	and i had quest cape
2015-10-05 23:16:31	kiburedokibu	Haha
2015-10-05 23:16:41	kiburedokibu	I already finished Roving Elves, thank god
2015-10-05 23:16:49	leechy9	I love the crystal bow
2015-10-05 23:16:57	sublme	crystal halberd from diaries
2015-10-05 23:16:57	kiburedokibu	Fnished Roving Elves, MM, etc.
2015-10-05 23:16:58	leechy9	That's the whole reason why I did it.
2015-10-05 23:17:04	sublme	halberd is stupid OP
2015-10-05 23:17:10	leechy9	I don't have 99 attack, so sadly, I can't get the halberd.
2015-10-05 23:17:11	sublme	maxes like 140
2015-10-05 23:17:44	leechy9	Oh god
2015-10-05 23:17:44	sublme	obviously doesnt work on players, same as dragon hally
2015-10-05 23:17:48	leechy9	Double Runescape
2015-10-05 23:17:49	sublme	but its still great
2015-10-05 23:18:09	siglemic	hm
2015-10-05 23:18:12	siglemic	how am i gonna do this
2015-10-05 23:18:23	leechy9	Maybe have the left one go down
2015-10-05 23:18:29	leechy9	And have right overlap the map
2015-10-05 23:18:36	kiburedokibu	Ewwwwwwwww
2015-10-05 23:18:41	kiburedokibu	Overlap is disgustin'
2015-10-05 23:18:53	sublme	@leechy9, you dont need 99 attack for C hally btw
2015-10-05 23:19:13	leechy9	Well, the right one would only cover the top corner of the left one.
2015-10-05 23:19:31	kiburedokibu	That looks pretty good
2015-10-05 23:19:32	leechy9	Also, I thought you needed the 99 attack to finish the events to unlock it.
2015-10-05 23:19:46	sublme	flashback to 2005 "reported for multi-logging"
2015-10-05 23:19:54	xyqq	damnit now I want to play, I just don't want to start over x.x
2015-10-05 23:20:10	kiburedokibu	It took me awhile to want to start over...
2015-10-05 23:20:13	kiburedokibu	But it was fun :P
2015-10-05 23:20:18	sublme	i enjoyed it actually
2015-10-05 23:20:23	kiburedokibu	Except for some quests..
2015-10-05 23:20:23	sublme	"nostalgia"
2015-10-05 23:20:44	xyqq	99 fish fletch cook agi str.. a lot of time wasted xD
2015-10-05 23:20:57	kiburedokibu	There's that word again. :P "wasted"
2015-10-05 23:21:31	mitchwoods	Oh shit Sig, I didn't know you played RS
2015-10-05 23:21:41	kiburedokibu	Not only does he play it
2015-10-05 23:21:45	kiburedokibu	He DOUBLE Plays it bro
2015-10-05 23:22:00	leechy9	It's not enough.
2015-10-05 23:22:04	leechy9	He needs to fish as well.
2015-10-05 23:22:09	sublme	we need 2 more screens
2015-10-05 23:22:09	mitchwoods	Yeah I usually have one on OSRS and one on RS#
2015-10-05 23:22:11	sublme	4 accounts
2015-10-05 23:22:12	mitchwoods	RS3*
2015-10-05 23:22:31	leechy9	Dude, fuck agility courses.
2015-10-05 23:22:36	mitchwoods	I was like "What's Runemaster" when I tuned in
2015-10-05 23:22:36	leechy9	I'm so goddamn tired of them.
2015-10-05 23:22:39	kiburedokibu	Eh they're good for moneys
2015-10-05 23:22:41	sublme	rooftops better than the old way
2015-10-05 23:22:42	leechy9	Getting to 56 was bad enough.
2015-10-05 23:22:48	kiburedokibu	I made 880k getting 70 agility. :P
2015-10-05 23:22:50	mitchwoods	Then it was like "90 Mining" and it dawned
2015-10-05 23:22:53	sublme	barb agility course made me hate life
2015-10-05 23:23:06	kiburedokibu	Understandable... Mitch. :P
2015-10-05 23:23:09	leechy9	The one I hated the most was stupid ass Varrock.
2015-10-05 23:23:14	leechy9	And Canifis too
2015-10-05 23:23:18	kiburedokibu	The fucking vanifis course, fuck.
2015-10-05 23:23:21	sublme	im talking about before rooftops
2015-10-05 23:23:21	kiburedokibu	Canifis
2015-10-05 23:23:25	sublme	when you didnt have a choice
2015-10-05 23:23:27	kiburedokibu	Once you get to Falador and stuff, it's better.
2015-10-05 23:23:34	sublme	i skipped falador
2015-10-05 23:23:38	kiburedokibu	I know Sublme, I still only have wilde course available.
2015-10-05 23:23:40	leechy9	Falador has all the buildings close together.
2015-10-05 23:23:43	sublme	i did canfis until seers
2015-10-05 23:23:43	kiburedokibu	In RS3 haha
2015-10-05 23:23:44	raddorex	i just started and havent played in a while. why does it seem like everyone has high hunter?
2015-10-05 23:23:44	optimusprimerib123z	man sig why are you training agi with all that extra shit weighing you down
2015-10-05 23:23:51	leechy9	Before they had the rooftop ones, I did the agility arena
2015-10-05 23:23:55	leechy9	That was actually kind of fun
2015-10-05 23:23:56	ablaij	falador is pretty bad, wildy is alot better
2015-10-05 23:23:59	leechy9	But then it gets old
2015-10-05 23:24:05	sublme	@Raddorex, because hunter is super fast to level and easy money
2015-10-05 23:24:08	mitchwoods	Sig how long have you been playing OSRS?
2015-10-05 23:24:08	stealinbread	oh baby a comfy sig runestream

2015-10-05 23:24:28	kiburedokibu	Ehhh I didn't care about graceful tbh.
2015-10-05 23:24:32	kiburedokibu	If anything I'd want the cape
2015-10-05 23:24:33	leechy9	I got half a set of graceful and called it a day.

2015-10-05 23:26:03	kcire_divad	lol
2015-10-05 23:26:04	sublme	motherlode made mining bearable for me
2015-10-05 23:26:14	sublme	clicking every ore was such shit
2015-10-05 23:26:17	fatgoku	I played no top 50 player in singles (even in friendlies) so I wasted my opportunity to improve I think
2015-10-05 23:26:26	fatgoku	also demon souls came Kreygasm
2015-10-05 23:26:33	kiburedokibu	Ohhh yes, kickass.
2015-10-05 23:26:40	kiburedokibu	I finally re-bought Dark Souls actually
2015-10-05 23:26:48	kiburedokibu	After a year of not playing it... I suuuck
2015-10-05 23:26:56	leechy9	The gains
2015-10-05 23:26:59	leechy9	Where are they?
2015-10-05 23:27:01	leechy9	left is being abused
2015-10-05 23:27:07	siglemic	awesome
2015-10-05 23:27:10	siglemic	you should stream it
2015-10-05 23:27:17	fatgoku	I dont have a way to stream it
2015-10-05 23:27:24	siglemic	ahhh fuck
2015-10-05 23:27:26	siglemic	when u gonna get a cap card
2015-10-05 23:27:26	kiburedokibu	Sig, send me console recording supplies.
2015-10-05 23:27:31	kiburedokibu	Send HIM*
2015-10-05 23:27:39	boreh32	Freudian slip
2015-10-05 23:27:44	siglemic	i linked him the good shit
2015-10-05 23:27:48	kiburedokibu	Very much so, I always have those, Boreh, lol.
2015-10-05 23:27:53	fatgoku	idk, I'll probably never gonna get hdmi stuff though
2015-10-05 23:28:13	fatgoku	I basically only wanna stream smash because I think I know enough about it to speak about it
2015-10-05 23:28:14	siglemic	how come you don't stream your lvl 1 dark souls stuff?
2015-10-05 23:28:17	kiburedokibu	Can you even do HDMI with PS3? I can't remember... Unless you HDCP-Strip it
2015-10-05 23:28:22	leechy9	hdmi stuff gets expensive because it has to clear the hdcp bullshit
2015-10-05 23:28:36	fatgoku	no one watches and it's not fun for me to stream when no one watches lol
2015-10-05 23:28:37	leechy9	There are a few capture cards that will register as being an hdcp compatible device.
2015-10-05 23:28:55	kiburedokibu	Oh, I see
2015-10-05 23:29:24	siglemic	u could just use push to talk and just play like you're on ur own until someone comes in
2015-10-05 23:29:32	siglemic	i think that's what i'd do if i hadn't grown a channel yet
2015-10-05 23:29:47	fatgoku	hmm I guess I could do that
2015-10-05 23:29:49	leechy9	And don't be overbearing
2015-10-05 23:29:54	leechy9	Let the viewer talk first
2015-10-05 23:29:57	kiburedokibu	Build a channel through SM64, then PUSH it all out the door, like Sig, and you're good. ;3
2015-10-05 23:30:01	kreirath	thats what i used to do
2015-10-05 23:30:11	leechy9	I hate being sniped when I show up to view someone's channel and I'm the only one.
2015-10-05 23:30:11	kiburedokibu	Sig used his SM64 agenda to push Runemaster, it's a fact.
2015-10-05 23:30:21	iamtheblacksheep	what happened to "in the zone"?
2015-10-05 23:30:30	chobro	wtf sig plays osrs?
2015-10-05 23:30:31	siglemic	still in the zone
2015-10-05 23:30:41	leechy9	Can't you see he's in double the zone?
2015-10-05 23:30:42	kiburedokibu	No, he doesn;t.
2015-10-05 23:30:48	kiburedokibu	That's why osrs isn't on the stream atm.
2015-10-05 23:30:53	kiburedokibu	...sorry... I'm being rude, lol
2015-10-05 23:30:56	chobro	alright no need to be a smart ass
2015-10-05 23:31:03	kiburedokibu	I know I know, sorry, lol
2015-10-05 23:31:08	chobro	LOL dw bout it
2015-10-05 23:31:43	kiburedokibu	I'll just blame it on my headache, I'll brb, I need meds. :P
2015-10-05 23:31:52	leechy9	Dude, fuck headaches.
2015-10-05 23:31:56	leechy9	I get those all the time now.
2015-10-05 23:32:14	leechy9	Ruin your damn day. You have to lower the brightness on your screen down to nothing to keep it from hurting.
2015-10-05 23:32:15	mitchwoods	I mean the lack of like any OSRS broadcasts on his channel
2015-10-05 23:32:26	mitchwoods	sure it comes as a surprise for a lot of people that he plays
2015-10-05 23:32:39	siglemic	i only just started playing again recently
2015-10-05 23:32:44	siglemic	i used to stream it occasionally
2015-10-05 23:33:09	leechy9	Does it feel good to have a chat that you can read again?
2015-10-05 23:33:15	leechy9	Like you can have conversations now.
2015-10-05 23:33:28	siglemic	i only remember what it's like to have a retard chat when i stream sm64
2015-10-05 23:33:30	siglemic	this is norm to me
2015-10-05 23:33:34	leechy9	I feel like if I were to be a big streamer, I would really miss my old chat.
2015-10-05 23:33:46	fatgoku	did you take out the "give me some samus love in the chat" in your description
2015-10-05 23:33:50	siglemic	i did
2015-10-05 23:34:00	siglemic	it threw off the alignment of my info
2015-10-05 23:34:16	fatgoku	oh
2015-10-05 23:34:17	mitchwoods	If it were up to me I'd prefer the smaller chats where you can have a conversation and chat cancer is really low
2015-10-05 23:34:20	fatgoku	I was hoping you didnt love samus anymore
2015-10-05 23:34:23	siglemic	lol
2015-10-05 23:34:28	fatgoku	1 day
2015-10-05 23:34:31	siglemic	you and every other smash player i play w.
2015-10-05 23:35:13	leechy9	Also, have you seen Jiano or Sicko lately? I haven't seen them on Twitch in like a year and I really need to snipe a Jape Crew comment soon.
2015-10-05 23:35:19	leechy9	I can't troll if they won't get online.
2015-10-05 23:35:21	kiburedokibu	Small chats are definitel the best, lol
2015-10-05 23:35:24	siglemic	they all do irl
2015-10-05 23:35:27	siglemic	i never talk to them
2015-10-05 23:36:04	siglemic	all my cool internet friends eventually get lives it kinda sux
2015-10-05 23:36:16	leechy9	Eh, that's life.
2015-10-05 23:36:22	kiburedokibu	I wish I could get a life. :P
2015-10-05 23:36:25	kiburedokibu	But eh, lol
2015-10-05 23:36:29	ziemas	jiano has been streaming rocket league on occasion
2015-10-05 23:36:55	leechy9	The worst thing is being a senior in college. All your friends have left and you won't see your new friends anymore either.
2015-10-05 23:37:01	umbreezy	do you have to pay for old runescape?

2015-10-05 23:46:25	kiburedokibu	Albums* Not songs.
2015-10-05 23:46:26	leechy9	I think every album has that one shitty song that nobody likes.
2015-10-05 23:46:29	kiburedokibu	I keep slipping.
2015-10-05 23:46:34	mail97	whats your goal on that 2nd account?

2015-10-05 23:46:48	mail97	ah cool
2015-10-05 23:46:53	kiburedokibu	oh yeah, that account
2015-10-05 23:46:54	siglemic	it's just an acc i made to snipe lvl 3 bots
2015-10-05 23:46:57	siglemic	while i mine rune on my main
2015-10-05 23:46:57	trueround	agil, for fun, are you joking?
2015-10-05 23:46:59	kiburedokibu	You still going to use it for injustice when mining?
2015-10-05 23:47:03	only_plays_medic	Is Darkscape out yet?
2015-10-05 23:47:04	siglemic	yep
2015-10-05 23:47:12	ablaij	miner timmie had it coming
2015-10-05 23:47:13	kiburedokibu	It's been out for a week or 2, Only_Plays
2015-10-05 23:47:14	trueround	how is that fun sig?
2015-10-05 23:47:17	mitchwoods	Yeah Darkscape's been out a few weeks
2015-10-05 23:47:17	mail97	i wouldnt say agil is that fun but its pretty relaxing
2015-10-05 23:47:18	leechy9	Darkscape doesn't apply to us oldies.
2015-10-05 23:47:24	only_plays_medic	Is Darkscape any good?
2015-10-05 23:47:26	siglemic	agil my favorite skill
2015-10-05 23:47:34	kiburedokibu	If you like RS3
2015-10-05 23:47:36	mitchwoods	It's honestly good fun if you like pvp
2015-10-05 23:47:37	leechy9	OSRS has deadman mode.
2015-10-05 23:47:46	siglemic	once you get into your zone, you memorize all the timings for the obstacles
2015-10-05 23:47:47	chobro	wat
2015-10-05 23:47:49	kiburedokibu	Not yet though Leechy... Not yet... BibleThump
2015-10-05 23:47:51	mail97	agility has the best cape/emote in the game imo
2015-10-05 23:47:53	siglemic	then u just auto pilot
2015-10-05 23:48:01	kiburedokibu	It's especially easy to auto-pilot with OSbuddy pro
2015-10-05 23:48:05	kiburedokibu	Though I don't have Pro, so eh...
2015-10-05 23:48:10	trueround	i get that agil is your favorite skill, but why grind it if you don't need it
2015-10-05 23:48:19	ablaij	then you start alching in between obstacles :)
2015-10-05 23:48:23	siglemic	u always need agil
2015-10-05 23:48:27	kiburedokibu	You'll always need Agility, forever and always
2015-10-05 23:48:28	leechy9	You need every skill to be 99 in Runescape.
2015-10-05 23:48:31	mitchwoods	Plus the fact that it is essentially all of RS3 content for free, Darkscape is a good thing to play
2015-10-05 23:48:34	leechy9	It's a NEED.
2015-10-05 23:48:38	trueround	not on an account you don't use sig xD
2015-10-05 23:48:44	kiburedokibu	He does use it. :p
2015-10-05 23:48:46	mail97	having 99 agility is so nice
2015-10-05 23:48:54	leechy9	Run for days
2015-10-05 23:48:56	siglemic	using it right now m8
2015-10-05 23:49:00	mail97	so many shortcuts and run restores fast

2015-10-05 23:51:35	leechy9	He's playing RS while listening to Daft Punk. The only thing he needs now is Newgrounds and AlbinoBlacksheep.

2015-10-05 23:52:58	kiburedokibu	Watching Twitch chat makes you go stupid.
2015-10-05 23:53:01	leechy9	That's why we're talking.
2015-10-05 23:53:02	kiburedokibu	It's a proven fact
2015-10-05 23:53:11	ablaij	nah this chats fine
2015-10-05 23:53:30	kiburedokibu	True, but I mean watching people like TrueRound say things does that, Kappa
2015-10-05 23:53:35	xingabus	Sig when you gonna stop dreaming, 90? Thats insane, you got kidz to feed yo
2015-10-05 23:53:50	leechy9	There's a mark of grace on the big roof.

2015-10-05 23:54:03	kiburedokibu	He can just feed them rocks, Xinga. :p

2015-10-05 23:54:12	mlink23	\ *** / HEY!
2015-10-05 23:54:20	trueround	most people have a logical reason of why they like something
2015-10-05 23:54:27	leechy9	He's going to work on 90 fishing soon so that he can feed them.
2015-10-05 23:54:51	leechy9	TrueRound, assume he's playing for nostalgia.
2015-10-05 23:54:56	leechy9	There you go.
2015-10-05 23:54:59	leechy9	Reason.
2015-10-05 23:55:21	siglemic	hm
2015-10-05 23:55:23	dalshai	im confused how is he using two screens?
2015-10-05 23:55:29	leechy9	He has two windows.
2015-10-05 23:55:33	leechy9	He's clicking in both
2015-10-05 23:55:35	aerythia	he has two arms
2015-10-05 23:55:38	siglemic	i'm getting double gains, listening to songs i like, and chatting with my friends
2015-10-05 23:55:41	dalshai	oh and two accounts?

2015-10-05 23:55:52	trueround	sig does it hurt that much to tell me yourself
2015-10-05 23:56:08	xingabus	Fun goes over the heads of mental midgets
2015-10-05 23:56:14	kiburedokibu	Aw Sig you're my friend too. :')
2015-10-05 23:56:22	leechy9	Wait a minute, I know this might sound stupid, but I think I have finally found a use for touch screen monitors.
2015-10-05 23:56:28	leechy9	Two runescapes would be so easy.
2015-10-05 23:56:34	leechy9	No dragging the mouse around.
2015-10-05 23:56:38	leechy9	Just instantly tap.
2015-10-05 23:56:41	dalshai	what other things that RS and smash do you play on stream sig?
2015-10-05 23:56:42	ablaij	people have used that for millions of magic xp per hour
2015-10-05 23:56:58	ablaij	cuz bolt enchants have no cast time
2015-10-05 23:57:07	kiburedokibu	Lol iirc one of the private servers I used to play has a tut up for how to play it on their phone
2015-10-05 23:57:23	leftyytwo	Some ore is ready to be collected from the sack.

2015-10-05 23:58:03	leechy9	^
2015-10-05 23:58:10	siglemic	naw the game got boring to me
2015-10-05 23:58:16	kiburedokibu	Understandable. :P
2015-10-05 23:58:17	leechy9	I love any game with a calm, aquatic theme to it.
2015-10-05 23:58:18	kiburedokibu	Bastard..
2015-10-05 23:58:21	kiburedokibu	Haha
2015-10-05 23:58:29	trueround	SIG WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ANYONE THAT YOU ARE GOING TO RUN SUPER METROID! \

2015-10-05 23:58:49	siglemic	i'm just in the process of learning rooms right now, not even i know if i'll stick with it
2015-10-05 23:58:49	signah	siglemic will become melee god
2015-10-05 23:58:50	leechy9	It makes him feel important.
2015-10-05 23:59:03	mitchwoods	Gzzzz
2015-10-05 23:59:18	kiburedokibu	Woo~
2015-10-05 23:59:24	trueround	kiburedokibu cause i would scream it IRL
2015-10-05 23:59:35	kiburedokibu	We would definitely not be friends IRL then, lol
2015-10-05 23:59:45	trueround	we don't have to be
2015-10-05 23:59:47	mitchwoods	TrueRound, u kay? You seem a little...
2015-10-05 23:59:52	trueround	fucking insane
2015-10-05 23:59:53	leechy9	He's going to have a hard time becoming melee god with Leffen being a real-life anime.
2015-10-05 23:59:54	xingabus	sig doing metroid is big news, i wonder if kotaku will pick it up ***
2015-10-05 23:59:55	trueround	i get that alot
2015-10-06 00:00:53	xingabus	"Speedrunner SillyEpidemic is now running Super Samsung Galaxy!" -Kotaku
2015-10-06 00:01:16	radicllarry	why are you training agility on an alt
2015-10-06 00:01:22	kiburedokibu	I haven't been to Kotaku in forever, lol
2015-10-06 00:01:23	leechy9	No, they don't approve of Super Metroid because the arm-pumping is considered a glitch.
2015-10-06 00:01:25	siglemic	somethin to do
2015-10-06 00:02:35	kiburedokibu	Man, this song has so many pewpewpews
2015-10-06 00:03:12	signah	hey siglemic. u r 1 cool guy
2015-10-06 00:04:32	leechy9	I am so sick of that guy waving to me in every agility course.
2015-10-06 00:04:38	leechy9	Leave me alone.
2015-10-06 00:04:41	siglemic	thx
2015-10-06 00:04:43	kiburedokibu	But that's BigManJapan, he's the sexiest
2015-10-06 00:04:43	leechy9	Stop reminding me of the laps.
2015-10-06 00:04:44	siglemic	ye fuck big red japan for realz
2015-10-06 00:04:47	ablaij	he used to say something every time you finished
2015-10-06 00:04:50	ablaij	was the worst
2015-10-06 00:04:50	radicllarry	I made an alt for wyverns, got it to 50/50 range/def using long range, and then got bored
2015-10-06 00:05:11	siglemic	bigredjapan was 70 agil for like 2 years after all his courses came out
2015-10-06 00:05:16	radicllarry	I cant play rs for longer than a few days at a time so i never get anything meaningful done
2015-10-06 00:05:20	leechy9	All he does is remind me that I have completed yet another lap. It snaps me out of the agility immersion.
2015-10-06 00:05:24	kiburedokibu	Lmao he never got 99?
2015-10-06 00:05:27	kiburedokibu	That's lame
2015-10-06 00:05:33	siglemic	it cracked me up
2015-10-06 00:05:59	leechy9	There's a reason why he doesn't award you the cape.
2015-10-06 00:06:03	siglemic	yo this song

2015-10-06 00:06:16	ablaij	he wasnt in the game when capes came out
2015-10-06 00:06:41	kiburedokibu	It was just a joke that he doesn't have a 99 cape, so he wouldn't be able to give them out, Ablaij. :p
2015-10-06 00:06:55	leechy9	lol, Ablaij taking things so literally
2015-10-06 00:06:59	ablaij	i'm slow BibleThump

2015-10-06 00:08:49	ablaij	takes so long to get 100% approval again
2015-10-06 00:08:51	leechy9	Do pickaxe heads still fall off and axe heads break?
2015-10-06 00:08:53	kiburedokibu	Man I am getting unlucky with Spiritual warriors... I need mooore monays
2015-10-06 00:09:14	kiburedokibu	I've never seen it happen, Leechy, so I don't think so
2015-10-06 00:09:17	kiburedokibu	(72 mining)
2015-10-06 00:09:36	leechy9	I remember stealing some dude's addy pickaxe head back in the day when I was a noob.
2015-10-06 00:09:43	siglemic	varrock agil is so slow holy fuck
2015-10-06 00:09:52	leechy9	Fate decided that I would be a miner that day.

2015-10-06 01:10:31	xwoxwo	i'd like to do stuff on 07, but i'm too lazy to do everything over again on it
2015-10-06 01:10:51	kiburedokibu	Once you get into Xwo, it gets addictive
2015-10-06 01:10:58	xwoxwo	nolifed it for like 3 weeks when it came out and then dropped it to go back to rs3
2015-10-06 01:11:00	kiburedokibu	Get into it*
2015-10-06 01:11:09	ablaij	early levels are the most fun imo
2015-10-06 01:12:08	xwoxwo	im sort of going for comp cape on rs3, but i just hate training dungeoneering

2015-10-06 01:14:02	xwoxwo	when oldschool came out i was able to make decent money selling black masks
2015-10-06 01:14:12	xwoxwo	hated jumping through the quest hoops to kill cave horrors
2015-10-06 01:14:22	xwoxwo	but they were pretty nice profit since everyone wanted to get 85 slayer fast
2015-10-06 01:14:27	kiburedokibu	That's true

2015-10-06 01:17:16	xwoxwo	you lose xp when you die in deadman right?
2015-10-06 01:17:21	kiburedokibu	They're making me a week to reset my defence, because I want to be a pure, lol

2015-10-06 04:08:02	siglemic	for there to be "drama" the person has to matter at least a little
2015-10-06 04:08:05	syndrux_lol	literally kept on complaining for like 30 minutes lol
2015-10-06 04:08:08	kiburedokibu	That makes sense haha.
2015-10-06 04:08:16	kiburedokibu	Backseating is the worst shit you can do
2015-10-06 04:08:31	hotbox818	backseaters need to be locked up in a cage and banned

2015-10-06 04:11:18	kiburedokibu	Speaking of that Sig, you're doing agility wrong, you should-
2015-10-06 04:11:18	urawizard_harry	jesus i haven't played RS in so long
2015-10-06 04:11:35	urawizard_harry	what are player numbers like, are worlds 1 and 2 still constantly full?
2015-10-06 04:11:42	eskimobob105	good thing i am but a poor appalachian turd miner. i have no knowledge to offer
2015-10-06 04:11:48	kiburedokibu	Well, for RS3, there's a lot of people there
2015-10-06 04:11:58	kiburedokibu	But I don't think enough people play for it to be 'full' anymore?
2015-10-06 04:12:08	urawizard_harry	oh man that's disappointing T.T
2015-10-06 04:12:10	hotbox818	i still play Rs3 i dont play much 07 but i enjoy watchin the streams
2015-10-06 04:12:18	urawizard_harry	I remember worlds 1 and 2 always had a queue to get in becasue they always had the full 2k
2015-10-06 04:12:31	siglemic	my right wrist is inflamed and it really hurts
2015-10-06 04:12:31	kiburedokibu	I'll check actually, I do have RS3 installed

2015-10-06 04:12:42	siglemic	so i think 90 mining will happen
2015-10-06 04:12:45	kiburedokibu	I'm just wondering, would just laying an ice pack on that help any Sig?
2015-10-06 04:12:53	kiburedokibu	Not that I'm trying to backseat your injury. ;)
2015-10-06 04:12:56	urawizard_harry	hard to play with an ice pack on
2015-10-06 04:13:00	siglemic	haha prob
2015-10-06 04:13:17	kiburedokibu	It wouldn't be too hard
2015-10-06 04:13:22	kiburedokibu	With high mouse sensitivity
2015-10-06 04:13:30	siglemic	i only play runescape when im injured on my right
2015-10-06 04:13:32	siglemic	which means i use my left
2015-10-06 04:13:33	k6rl	you should listen to some monstercat, like a real runescape streamer does Kappa 123
2015-10-06 04:13:40	urawizard_harry	i think i quit rs in like 2011 or so just cause the economy got completely bodied : /
2015-10-06 04:13:40	kiburedokibu	Oh yeah, I forgot about that.
2015-10-06 04:13:47	gothiclogic	Hello Sig
2015-10-06 04:13:56	mrfirestorm	Hey Gothic.
2015-10-06 04:14:03	kiburedokibu	"Fetching updates" Baahhh hurry
2015-10-06 04:14:10	eskimobob105	im certain a wristband or a sleeve wouldnt hurt it either. im a drummer and get inflamed tendons every so often.
2015-10-06 04:14:22	eskimobob105	i just try to stretch em out and let em rest
2015-10-06 04:14:43	eskimobob105	*backseating game too stronk*
2015-10-06 04:15:05	kiburedokibu	It is 3:13 A.M. here, but world 2 is the highest at ~830 players
2015-10-06 04:15:19	mrfirestorm	Wait sig I thought feign sleep was your miner timmy killer account
2015-10-06 04:15:29	siglemic	tis
2015-10-06 04:15:33	mrfirestorm	did you just want to get more agility also I though roofs were better for xp
2015-10-06 04:15:39	urawizard_harry	ahk
2015-10-06 04:15:43	kiburedokibu	He can't go to canifis fufufufu
2015-10-06 04:15:43	siglemic	staying 1 pray
2015-10-06 04:15:48	mrfirestorm	oh RIP
2015-10-06 04:15:55	urawizard_harry	830, not too dead then. Still kinda sad to see how much its dropped
2015-10-06 04:16:07	urawizard_harry	I would put money that none of my old friends play anymore
2015-10-06 04:16:11	mrfirestorm	I killed my interest in rs again :/
2015-10-06 04:16:11	eskimobob105	hey but theres less cancer
2015-10-06 04:16:13	kiburedokibu	There are a LOT more players on OSRS
2015-10-06 04:16:24	eskimobob105	and thats true as well
2015-10-06 04:16:28	kiburedokibu	2 top worlds in OSRS - 902/900
2015-10-06 04:16:31	eskimobob105	07 scape is super popular still
2015-10-06 04:16:38	kiburedokibu	Because it's good. <3
2015-10-06 04:16:43	kiburedokibu	I wanna try out the new abyssal weapons
2015-10-06 04:16:48	hotbox818	osrs is chill
2015-10-06 04:16:50	eskimobob105	^^ true that
2015-10-06 04:16:51	mrfirestorm	rs3 is not bad though I don't like it much lol
2015-10-06 04:16:56	urawizard_harry	oh kk 900 each.. thats respectable
2015-10-06 04:17:12	kiburedokibu	Well it slowly drops lower than each subsequent world, Ura
2015-10-06 04:17:18	kiburedokibu	850+ is world 3, etc.
2015-10-06 04:17:20	mrfirestorm	they're both cool games though rs2 is more enjoyable imo
2015-10-06 04:17:23	kiburedokibu	Er not world 3, whatever.
2015-10-06 04:17:37	kiburedokibu	And I just took a break from RS3 today Mrfirestorm. :P
2015-10-06 04:17:39	urawizard_harry	yea that makes sense
2015-10-06 04:17:43	mrfirestorm	:P
2015-10-06 04:17:47	hotbox818	reason i still play Rs3 is i clocked in too much time to just abandon it and all the skills iv trained
2015-10-06 04:18:02	mrfirestorm	I would give you a bond to play harry but I'm saving one incase I get the urge to play again.
2015-10-06 04:18:07	mrfirestorm	:/
2015-10-06 04:18:14	mrfirestorm	Btw how much are they atm in osrs?

2015-10-06 04:18:23	mrfirestorm	decent.
2015-10-06 04:18:40	syndrux_lol	how common are bots now?

2015-10-06 04:18:53	kiburedokibu	It feels like I'm running short quickly, lol
2015-10-06 04:18:58	kiburedokibu	Depends on where you go, Syn.
2015-10-06 04:18:58	mrfirestorm	tfw you go on smash ladder and no one is playing project M BibleThump
2015-10-06 04:19:01	syndrux_lol	I remember it was hard to even get resources when I quit because every world had bots everywhere
2015-10-06 04:19:03	kiburedokibu	Green drags is a bot sex pit.

2015-10-06 04:27:12	kiburedokibu	He's training skills on two characters.
2015-10-06 04:27:21	prelexx	sig, do you know why you're my favorite streamer? It's because you're not afraid to be who you are. Sure your alternative lifestyle may not sit well with some, but I think you are one of the best gay streamers on twitch and you are a great role model. I know some people probably don't understand, but I do
2015-10-06 04:27:22	g4ssy	what's deadman?
2015-10-06 04:27:34	kiburedokibu	Hardcore OSRS Server that should be releasing this month.

2015-10-06 04:28:28	kiburedokibu	Though if you want to play a hardcore server and not a member, Darkscape is free and has members content, hardcore though as well
2015-10-06 04:28:32	syndrux_lol	hardcore server?
2015-10-06 04:28:37	kiburedokibu	But... that's with the RS3 engine
2015-10-06 04:29:03	kiburedokibu	What's your question, Syndrux? :P
2015-10-06 04:29:06	siglemic	i know all of runescape's bangers

2015-10-06 04:29:45	siglemic	you know runescape's music is "progressive rock"?

2015-10-06 04:30:04	kiburedokibu	http://2007.runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Deadman_mode
2015-10-06 04:30:05	mrfirestorm	I actually like all smash games besides brawl
2015-10-06 04:30:19	mrfirestorm	There is also a free to play global pvp thing for rs3
2015-10-06 04:30:22	mrfirestorm	with legacy combat I think
2015-10-06 04:30:26	strytec	The wiiu smash is kinda shitty too
2015-10-06 04:30:28	kiburedokibu	I mentioned that one, Mrfirestorm.
2015-10-06 04:30:31	kiburedokibu	Darkscape.
2015-10-06 04:30:44	strytec	original smash and melee is where its at
2015-10-06 04:30:55	mrfirestorm	ah, ok.
2015-10-06 04:31:05	mrfirestorm	I don't think its shitty its just really different
2015-10-06 04:31:05	minearm	Melee is just nostalgia :^)
2015-10-06 04:31:13	mrfirestorm	I don't hate it but its not my favorite
2015-10-06 04:31:13	kiburedokibu	It feels nice to help people out with stuff I actually know. :3
2015-10-06 04:31:23	urawizard_harry	is darkspace active/any good
2015-10-06 04:31:25	mrfirestorm	I most likely it enjoy smash 4 more than melee simply because I'm better at it
2015-10-06 04:31:25	minearm	sm4sh is the best smash game
2015-10-06 04:31:39	kiburedokibu	It's pretty fun, I think Ura, you'd just have to see for yourself.
2015-10-06 04:31:40	mrfirestorm	I will agree that smash 4 is a lot more casual friendly than melee/pm
2015-10-06 04:31:50	kiburedokibu	And it's pretty active
2015-10-06 04:32:05	urawizard_harry	yeah i was a pretty active pker in like 2009 ill probably try it and see if i still have it
2015-10-06 04:32:21	strytec	I've never owned a smash game, just played them at parties and with mates. I had very little fun on the wiiu with smash, and hyrule warriors is equally terrible
2015-10-06 04:32:31	siglemic	does anyone know if it's possible to use 2 mice on windows

2015-10-06 04:41:58	gothiclogic	Well IIRC the end of 91 is halfway to 99
2015-10-06 04:42:00	kiburedokibu	Ah okay, makes sense.
2015-10-06 04:42:04	hotbox818	deadman seems brutal since you lose exp on death and other stuff
2015-10-06 04:42:12	gothiclogic	But you might as well say 92
2015-10-06 04:42:12	simpleflips	the end of 91 is the start of 92 ;)
2015-10-06 04:42:19	nozzlepops	its 91 by like 250 xp
2015-10-06 04:42:24	siglemic	92 isn't true halfway
2015-10-06 04:42:35	simpleflips	oh
2015-10-06 04:42:36	siglemic	because better ore xp/increased rate of mining

2015-10-06 04:42:48	siglemic	true half is around 89 or 90 i'd say

2015-10-06 04:54:47	gothiclogic	15m lmao fucking Sparc Mac paid 110m or something for it
2015-10-06 04:54:48	dm_dean	Daggers gonna go up if they make the spec better
2015-10-06 04:54:54	hotbox818	im bad luck at gettin pets i have soo many boss kills and 0 pets BibleThump
2015-10-06 04:54:55	tikonater	abyssal dagger is 15m???

2015-10-06 04:55:08	strong_badam	wtf is the abyssal dagger
2015-10-06 04:55:14	simpleflips	Nah Dean
2015-10-06 04:55:16	kiburedokibu	New abyssal weapon
2015-10-06 04:55:16	simpleflips	It's only going to go down.
2015-10-06 04:55:19	tikonater	new wep in game
2015-10-06 04:55:20	strong_badam	better than whip?
2015-10-06 04:55:22	simpleflips	If it was out for a long time and then they made the spec better
2015-10-06 04:55:25	simpleflips	Then it would go up
2015-10-06 04:55:35	dm_dean	whats that logic
2015-10-06 04:55:39	kiburedokibu	I'd say it's on par, mostly useful for its spec, Badam.
2015-10-06 04:55:39	simpleflips	supply and demand
2015-10-06 04:55:39	tikonater	spec is shit lol
2015-10-06 04:55:42	dm_dean	they wanna give it 4 specs and make it more accurater
2015-10-06 04:55:42	nozzlepops	***
2015-10-06 04:55:43	simpleflips	Low supply currently
2015-10-06 04:55:44	strong_badam	if it's new and based on a new mosnter drop
2015-10-06 04:55:44	kiburedokibu	There's another abyssal weapon too
2015-10-06 04:55:48	strong_badam	the price is high bc of low supply
2015-10-06 04:55:51	simpleflips	^^
2015-10-06 04:55:57	simpleflips	Economics 101 bitch
2015-10-06 04:56:02	strong_badam	hasnt stabilized bc the supply/demand hasn't reached equilibrium
2015-10-06 04:56:04	kiburedokibu	Abyssal Bludgeon, STR only, yeah, 30m
2015-10-06 04:56:18	dm_dean	bludgeon is proving to be more useless every day
2015-10-06 04:56:26	dm_dean	2 handedness ruins it
2015-10-06 04:56:35	simpleflips	deans mad because he's mad

2015-10-06 04:57:17	dm_dean	runescape died when eoc came out
2015-10-06 04:57:22	dm_dean	osrs is its last legs imo
2015-10-06 04:57:27	tikonater	^^^
2015-10-06 04:57:27	simpleflips	Barely reaching 500 is an improvement over the barely reaching 300
2015-10-06 04:57:27	kiburedokibu	There's many worlds on OSRS that have 700+, lol
2015-10-06 04:57:29	gothiclogic	Barely reaching 500 what
2015-10-06 04:57:34	mubiparipovic	This looks so stupis but awesome
2015-10-06 04:57:36	kiburedokibu	Do these people know what the fuck they're talking about?

2015-10-06 05:02:38	strong_badam	i forgot miner timmie existed
2015-10-06 05:02:41	kiburedokibu	"The Jmods are looking into a way that bonds can be given to an offline account so the trade doesn't need to be standing next to each other." Thank fucking god

2015-10-06 05:02:58	strongbadstronk	i guess im a noob, since i play rs3
2015-10-06 05:03:02	hotbox818	Night Simple
2015-10-06 05:03:08	kiburedokibu	You checked him out, Sig? xD
2015-10-06 05:03:13	kiburedokibu	Man he is dedicated.
2015-10-06 05:03:20	strong_badam	rs3 is ok, ppl try to hipster osrs a bit much
2015-10-06 05:03:24	siglemic	no hypothetical
2015-10-06 05:03:26	siglemic	but possible
2015-10-06 05:03:27	strong_badam	i prefer osrs
2015-10-06 05:03:34	kiburedokibu	I love playing RS3 still, Badam
2015-10-06 05:03:39	kiburedokibu	But yes, I completely still see the faults
2015-10-06 05:03:49	nozzlepops	i feel overwhelmed on rs3
2015-10-06 05:03:56	grandcathedral	and it feels like me on a good dayyyyyyyyy
2015-10-06 05:04:01	strongbadstronk	i just think they need to tone back the items they give out in rs3
2015-10-06 05:04:09	strongbadstronk	they give bank space to accomodate it
2015-10-06 05:04:13	kiburedokibu	Yeah, it's extreme.
2015-10-06 05:04:13	hotbox818	i just Play Rs3 since i dropped too much time on it to abandon it i do enjoy the Osrs streams
2015-10-06 05:04:13	strongbadstronk	kinda out of control
2015-10-06 05:04:34	kiburedokibu	I hate how they multiplied the health and damage by like 100
2015-10-06 05:04:40	kiburedokibu	I prefer the smaller numbers
2015-10-06 05:04:47	strongbadstronk	legacy mode
2015-10-06 05:04:50	redhotpower	I hate how much eaiser it is compared to osrs
2015-10-06 05:04:55	kiburedokibu	Still multiplied by 10, strong.
2015-10-06 05:05:04	kiburedokibu	I feel special when I hit 20+ on osrs... :(
2015-10-06 05:05:07	hotbox818	yeah Rs3 is easier faster xp Rates :3
2015-10-06 05:05:19	dm_dean	OSRS problem is it has no noobs
2015-10-06 05:05:19	strongbadstronk	rs3 has different combat options
2015-10-06 05:05:22	strong_badam	droppin 28s w whip like yolo
2015-10-06 05:05:23	redhotpower	every time i see someone they are maxed and it demotivates me to play
2015-10-06 05:05:23	dm_dean	and theres no item sinks
2015-10-06 05:05:29	i_stack_them	why u dont do rooftops?
2015-10-06 05:05:34	strongbadstronk	they have old school combat, simplified and then press buttons mode
2015-10-06 05:05:35	i_stack_them	for graceful
2015-10-06 05:05:38	siglemic	because reasons
2015-10-06 05:05:44	kiburedokibu	I switch between legacy and revolution.
2015-10-06 05:05:56	kiburedokibu	I just dropped like 10m on a Blood Amulet of Fury though lol, so that helps legacy
2015-10-06 05:05:56	strongbadstronk	i use revolution
2015-10-06 05:06:07	pickenpocalypse	is Siglemic playing two accounts at once?
2015-10-06 05:06:11	kiburedokibu	Blood Amulet of Fury kicks so much ass
2015-10-06 05:06:12	hotbox818	they have legacy mode were its old style combat and Legacy Eoc mode were it auto's your abilitys
2015-10-06 05:06:18	strong_badam	are you gonna do wildy course? you seem a bit unfocused to do wildy course
2015-10-06 05:06:34	siglemic	ye
2015-10-06 05:06:40	strongbadstronk	they have predetermined sets for skills in revolution mode
2015-10-06 05:06:42	kiburedokibu	Reason why I don't use legacy as much, strongbad... EoC has player regen, it's so OP lol
2015-10-06 05:06:44	strongbadstronk	for max dps
2015-10-06 05:06:47	strongbadstronk	check into that
2015-10-06 05:07:22	strongbadstronk	i use maybe 5 bars of skills
2015-10-06 05:07:34	pickenpocalypse	!uptime

2015-10-06 05:49:06	buggit	This doesn't seem efficient, you're training both accounts less than half as fast DansGame
2015-10-06 05:49:19	siglemic	i think im doing fine
2015-10-06 05:49:25	kiburedokibu	If you REALLY think about it buggit... Shut up, lol
2015-10-06 05:49:31	quantumz1	atleest he isnt botting :D
2015-10-06 05:49:33	dm_dean	the fact that torso/rune/slayer helm is best in slot in and outr of pvp is so satisfying
2015-10-06 05:49:41	dm_dean	for me anyway
2015-10-06 05:49:48	buggit	Maybe I came at a bad time
2015-10-06 05:49:50	quantumz1	just started rs again cause bored of csgo
2015-10-06 05:50:02	kiburedokibu	I feel like shit because I still only use a rune pl8 when melee'ing
2015-10-06 05:50:09	kiburedokibu	I need a torso, I'm just lazy lol
2015-10-06 05:50:13	dm_dean	even maxed mains wear rune still
2015-10-06 05:50:28	dm_dean	rune and mystic is basic gear for a main its good stuff
2015-10-06 05:50:31	kiburedokibu	Nobody likes dchain smexiness? lol
2015-10-06 05:51:38	kiburedokibu	Man I'm running on 30k, wonder if I'll be able to buy range gear to kill blue drags with that. :P
2015-10-06 05:51:41	dm_dean	unless you're over 100cb it can be hard finding a team that actually knows how to play
2015-10-06 05:52:15	buggit	Do you miss the viewership sm64 brought you or not bothered @siglemic
2015-10-06 05:52:16	dm_dean	if you've done death to dorshegunn use a zaniks crossbow and bone bolts
2015-10-06 05:52:21	dm_dean	cheap and good
2015-10-06 05:52:39	kiburedokibu	I haven't, actually
2015-10-06 05:52:43	siglemic	is it not clear that i have low viewers intentionally?
2015-10-06 05:53:02	dm_dean	¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Kibured
2015-10-06 05:53:07	dm_dean	30k is a small budget =S
2015-10-06 05:53:07	strong_badam	low view stream can be pretty comfy
2015-10-06 05:53:20	kiburedokibu	Yep, I swapped my 4.4m for RS3 gold lol
2015-10-06 05:53:23	game_of_skill	takes the interaction to a new level
2015-10-06 05:53:41	buggit	It wasn't clear to me no
2015-10-06 05:53:59	dm_dean	why do that if you're back on osrs
2015-10-06 05:54:01	kiburedokibu	Smalled defined chats are the way to go
2015-10-06 05:54:04	dm_dean	questionable move
2015-10-06 05:54:08	kiburedokibu	Because I still want to play both of them.
2015-10-06 05:54:16	kiburedokibu	92 range atm on RS3, going for 99
2015-10-06 05:54:34	dm_dean	is chinning good on rs3
2015-10-06 05:54:43	kiburedokibu	Half as good since they nerfed prayer
2015-10-06 05:54:44	quantumz1	im like maxed on rs3 but i just dont enjoy the game anymore
2015-10-06 05:54:56	hotbox818	im glad i got 99 range off chining before eoc happend
2015-10-06 05:54:58	kiburedokibu	Protect From only grants 50% protection now
2015-10-06 05:55:05	hotbox818	i doubt its any good now since you gotta kill the monsters for the xp
2015-10-06 05:55:22	dm_dean	maxing can be boring, kinda gives you less things to do
2015-10-06 05:55:28	quantumz1	i got 99 mage and def in like a week
2015-10-06 05:55:31	quantumz1	because of eoc
2015-10-06 05:55:31	kiburedokibu	Either do slayer and crap, lol
2015-10-06 05:55:42	game_of_skill	main reason i don't play rs3 is eoc
2015-10-06 05:55:42	kiburedokibu	80 slayer atm
2015-10-06 05:55:51	game_of_skill	i don't like RS3 graphic style either
2015-10-06 05:55:57	game_of_skill	the game feels clunky
2015-10-06 05:56:00	game_of_skill	compared to OSRS
2015-10-06 05:56:01	dm_dean	i got 99 range and mage in a week on osrs ;)
2015-10-06 05:56:05	hotbox818	i still enjoy Rs3 i just wanna max and get 120 capes and i dont care for graphics lol
2015-10-06 05:56:17	quantumz1	only good thing about rs3 is being able to power fish and drop the fish without mousekeys
2015-10-06 05:56:17	dm_dean	120 capes :o
2015-10-06 05:56:40	hotbox818	yep Master capes were you get 104m exp on a skill
2015-10-06 05:56:44	kiburedokibu	Plus I dropped 10m on a kickass amulet, so I gotta make that back
2015-10-06 05:56:45	dm_dean	why dont they round it off to 100m lol
2015-10-06 05:56:59	nozzlepops	just how the exp system worked out
2015-10-06 05:57:03	hotbox818	would be nice if it was 100m but meh lol
2015-10-06 05:57:16	dm_dean	yeah fair enough
2015-10-06 05:57:20	kiburedokibu	Well, if you get 100m, shouldn't hut to get 4m more. :P
2015-10-06 05:57:24	kiburedokibu	Hurt*
2015-10-06 05:57:43	hotbox818	fishing was my 1st since it was easy, twitch and Buddah and beers help lol
2015-10-06 05:57:56	kiburedokibu	I find fishing... to be one of the most boring. xD
2015-10-06 05:57:58	dm_dean	damn thats nice
2015-10-06 05:58:04	dm_dean	did you barb fish/
2015-10-06 05:58:08	hotbox818	fishing is boring but i liked the money
2015-10-06 05:58:12	hotbox818	nah i did rocktails
2015-10-06 05:58:14	game_of_skill	i wish skills went over 99
2015-10-06 05:58:17	game_of_skill	like 120
2015-10-06 05:58:19	kiburedokibu	I don't
2015-10-06 05:58:23	kiburedokibu	99 is a sexy number
2015-10-06 05:58:31	itchy_eyeball	what level did you start motherlaodmine???
2015-10-06 05:58:40	dm_dean	if pre-eoc still existed i'd vote for that
2015-10-06 05:58:41	siglemic	56?
2015-10-06 05:58:45	game_of_skill	13-200M exp is in its essence worthless
2015-10-06 05:58:47	game_of_skill	i hate that
2015-10-06 05:58:58	quantumz1	i hate how the rs community is fractured
2015-10-06 05:59:06	itchy_eyeball	ah alright im 48 doing granite right now, im unsure if i should head to mtoherload.
2015-10-06 05:59:07	quantumz1	its like we should all play 1 game instead of 2
2015-10-06 05:59:16	dm_dean	yehp
2015-10-06 05:59:25	dm_dean	pre-eoc runescape was the best time
2015-10-06 05:59:31	hotbox818	i actually have a 200m skill life wasted :3
2015-10-06 05:59:32	dm_dean	all pplayed one game with a perfect combat system
2015-10-06 05:59:40	game_of_skill	both games have enough players
2015-10-06 05:59:44	planetzapp	which song is this from gorillaZ?
2015-10-06 05:59:50	quantumz1	osrs has enough bots dont you mean XD
2015-10-06 06:00:06	game_of_skill	not like RS3 has any bots
2015-10-06 06:00:23	ff42	well minecraft hasnt changed a lot in 6 years
2015-10-06 06:00:26	lonan_	people still bot in these games? lol
2015-10-06 06:00:31	quantumz1	i dont play rs3
2015-10-06 06:00:31	kiburedokibu	I wish range had more off-hand equipment
2015-10-06 06:00:36	game_of_skill	me neither
2015-10-06 06:00:39	quantumz1	but i play osrs and all i ever see is bots
2015-10-06 06:00:49	hotbox818	rs3 has its Green Dragon bots lol
2015-10-06 06:00:49	joeys64	lonan rs is actually really popular again these days
2015-10-06 06:01:01	game_of_skill	if you're hunting, sure
2015-10-06 06:01:02	shadna	A 2b+ xp account in rs3 got banned last week for botting fishing
2015-10-06 06:01:22	game_of_skill	but the botters are usually RWT ones
2015-10-06 06:01:22	hotbox818	lolo GG
2015-10-06 06:01:24	lonan_	is there a reason for that joey?
2015-10-06 06:01:35	lonan_	i liked it in 2007 but now
2015-10-06 06:01:38	nozzlepops	red chin bots ***
2015-10-06 06:01:41	hotbox818	i wouldnt dare bot not like i need to and its not worth it

2015-10-06 06:01:56	game_of_skill	OSRS is fantastic
2015-10-06 06:01:58	dm_dean	if you bot you dont give a shit about the game lol
2015-10-06 06:02:00	game_of_skill	the updates been great
2015-10-06 06:02:17	hotbox818	exactly Dean
2015-10-06 06:02:29	hotbox818	but a guy with 2B total exp botting lol thats just something
2015-10-06 06:02:40	game_of_skill	some people bot because they don't have enough free time to play
2015-10-06 06:02:45	game_of_skill	and they want to reach end content
2015-10-06 06:02:47	shadna	Pretty sure they were comped too
2015-10-06 06:02:50	dm_dean	hotbox did you hear about guy with 5.2b being banned
2015-10-06 06:03:00	divisination	Hey sit I'm a new fox main, I've got most of my basic tech down (not really) but I can't find a guide/video on how to side-b short anywhere (not really sure what it's called). Any tips?
2015-10-06 06:03:03	hotbox818	yeah i heard about it
2015-10-06 06:03:10	dm_dean	at RuneFest rank 10 with 5.2B exp headbutted and punched rank 7 player LMAO
2015-10-06 06:03:19	hotbox818	heard he fought someone at runefest or something about Ranks
2015-10-06 06:03:26	strong_badam	iirc sideb shorten timings are between frames 21-23 or 22-24 dont remember
2015-10-06 06:03:26	kiburedokibu	It'd be great if they put that 5.2b in the wishing well for charity, lol
2015-10-06 06:03:38	dm_dean	5.2b exp not gp
2015-10-06 06:03:39	nozzlepops	that really happened? lol

2015-10-06 06:04:20	hotbox818	it was just like a nerd fight and he called him out and hes like fuck this guy and gives him a headbutt lol
2015-10-06 06:04:24	dm_dean	who headbutts someone what statement are you trying to make
2015-10-06 06:04:30	joeys64	not sure lonan, its been increasing in popularity since osrs came out so its fair to think that had a big influence
2015-10-06 06:05:03	hotbox818	if he wanted to fight him at least do it away from jagex so you dont get banned KappaCool

2015-10-08 00:44:32	kiburedokibu	I always see it's usually the full void guys that crash me :p
2015-10-08 00:44:39	ablaij	hard for pures to get 2k total so wildy is super safe
2015-10-08 00:44:46	kiburedokibu	Something about someone being full void makes them think they're better than you :'(
2015-10-08 00:45:07	x_muzza_x	you need like atleast 87 in all skills to be 2k total
2015-10-08 00:45:12	x_muzza_x	so its a big effot

2015-10-11 20:37:45	numberplay	but i never saw cosmo play rs
2015-10-11 20:37:52	numberplay	that's why im surprised
2015-10-11 20:37:57	siglemic	what do you mean
2015-10-11 20:37:59	monstersuits_alyssa	hi sig
2015-10-11 20:38:08	siglemic	@Slithz,
2015-10-11 20:38:08	ritchgaming	is this music from oblivion? lol
2015-10-11 20:38:10	numberplay	you can put it in fullscreen mode
2015-10-11 20:38:10	slithz	On OSB, if you hold shift and drag it, you can stretch it
2015-10-11 20:38:11	bradenhowse	he means change gameplay resolution
2015-10-11 20:38:17	slithz	so you dont have the bars on the side
2015-10-11 20:38:23	slithz	It's what most RS streamers to do avoid that
2015-10-11 20:38:29	siglemic	oh
2015-10-11 20:38:33	siglemic	i don't like resizable
2015-10-11 20:38:38	slithz	no
2015-10-11 20:38:48	bradenhowse	also doesn't give classic rs feel ;)
2015-10-11 20:38:51	slithz	I mean on osbuddy, you click edit scene on your Runescape source
2015-10-11 20:39:02	slithz	then you hold shift and drag the red box to stretch it
2015-10-11 20:39:03	nokzide	PogChamp
2015-10-11 20:39:05	siglemic	you mean... obs?

2015-10-11 20:39:17	slithz	i mean obs lmfao
2015-10-11 20:39:22	slegersloth	PogChamp
2015-10-11 20:39:27	imotogames	changing aspect ratio usually doesnt look good
2015-10-11 20:39:35	slithz	literally all streamers do it
2015-10-11 20:39:38	imotogames	especially if a game is 4:3 by default and not 16:9
2015-10-11 20:39:45	siglemic	i'd rather just keep it like this
2015-10-11 20:39:48	imotogames	just because streamers do it doesnt mean it looks good
2015-10-11 20:39:58	slithz	i mean it looks better
2015-10-11 20:40:03	slithz	the bars on the side throws it off
2015-10-11 20:40:04	siglemic	:O it does not!
2015-10-11 20:40:11	siglemic	those bars are groovy you fuck
2015-10-11 20:40:20	kroppkakor	Have you played alot of Runescape before Mario Siglemic?

2015-10-11 20:40:40	monstersuits_alyssa	"groovy" yeah ok
2015-10-11 20:40:43	slithz	notice house the thing is stretched a bit more?
2015-10-11 20:40:51	slithz	the game isn't stretched, but the stream portion of it is
2015-10-11 20:40:54	slithz	its just for viewer comfort
2015-10-11 20:41:03	fizzy_xp	sparc mac's stream LOL
2015-10-11 20:41:05	fizzy_xp	what a guy
2015-10-11 20:41:07	siglemic	the game is stretched
2015-10-11 20:41:10	xyqq	It looks weird all stretched like that
2015-10-11 20:41:11	slithz	i clicked the first one
2015-10-11 20:41:13	slithz	the game isnt stretched
2015-10-11 20:41:14	ryusensei	im just here for the sigradio Kappa
2015-10-11 20:41:15	slithz	its the stream
2015-10-11 20:41:21	slithz	the pixelation of the game would get wrecked
2015-10-11 20:41:26	slegersloth	the hell man whats so bad on sidebars lol
2015-10-11 20:41:29	siglemic	FailFish
2015-10-11 20:41:32	imotogames	it does look weird, because theyre stretching 4:3 to 16:9 lol
2015-10-11 20:41:36	slithz	I'm just letting you know
2015-10-11 20:41:47	slithz	you're streaming 16:9
2015-10-11 20:41:49	slithz	and fitting 4:3
2015-10-11 20:41:53	slithz	and having the bars appear
2015-10-11 20:41:56	siglemic	it's not really 4:3, it's a bit wider, so it looks slightly less awkward when stretched to 16:9, but it's still bad
2015-10-11 20:42:03	akruez	that morrowind music though
2015-10-11 20:42:12	intars11	hey man
2015-10-11 20:42:20	siglemic	just cause sparc mac is popular youtuber, doesn't mean he knows what he is doing
2015-10-11 20:42:23	ablaij	ya rs is like 8:5 or something weird
2015-10-11 20:42:47	dryshade	Don't bother stretching it, it looks better as is
2015-10-11 20:42:48	slegersloth	We want sidebars!

2015-10-11 20:43:51	akruez	no its morrwind >_>
2015-10-11 20:44:02	imotogames	its by jeremy soule, so understandable to get it mistaken
2015-10-11 20:44:03	kohai_ssb	the hell is morrwind
2015-10-11 20:44:05	ryusensei	and if you get assisted in killing something, you forfeit loot ***
2015-10-11 20:44:07	spiritfox123	you can see things other players drop, you just can't pick them up

2015-10-11 20:49:36	slithz	lets you know where the veins are
2015-10-11 20:49:38	slithz	in MLM
2015-10-11 20:49:48	spiritfox123	OSB is the cheater client Kappa
2015-10-11 20:49:49	kroppkakor	Is that legal?
2015-10-11 20:49:57	slithz	of course lmfao
2015-10-11 20:49:57	akruez	ofc
2015-10-11 20:49:58	phil7823	hahah ofc its legal
2015-10-11 20:50:02	imotogames	can you not just...see where they are at by looking at the wall?
2015-10-11 20:50:03	kroppkakor	Okay
2015-10-11 20:50:05	imotogames	they look pretty obvious
2015-10-11 20:50:09	slithz	like a third of the population uses osb
2015-10-11 20:50:11	phil7823	you can, but its faster for multitasking
2015-10-11 20:50:23	spiritfox123	i use the official client
2015-10-11 20:50:28	phil7823	allows you to zoom out and always have 2-3 sets of veins in your view
2015-10-11 20:50:34	spiritfox123	i'd feel scummy using OSB
2015-10-11 20:50:40	slithz	well
2015-10-11 20:50:40	ryusensei	but the stronghold of security advises me against third party clients Kappa
2015-10-11 20:50:44	slithz	osb pro has nice features
2015-10-11 20:50:45	siglemic	i actually hate that overlay shit and can get 48k/hr at mlm without so whatev
2015-10-11 20:50:49	slithz	like letting you know w hen your crops are over
2015-10-11 20:50:49	slegersloth	@Slithz Just because others do it why should everyone do it?
2015-10-11 20:50:55	phil7823	no reason to feel scummy, increases the flow of information
2015-10-11 20:51:02	slithz	Not everyone would, I was just letting the streamer know
2015-10-11 20:51:13	slithz	I assumed he put up a background because he didnt know
2015-10-11 20:51:15	siglemic	same w/ agility overlay. feels pointless if you just learn where you're supposed to click
2015-10-11 20:51:24	slithz	You can toggle off a lot of things
2015-10-11 20:51:34	slithz	agility overlay is nice if you're trying to tick perfect
2015-10-11 20:51:35	phil7823	I mean it does make it a bit easier, but yeah I agree it really isn't necessary
2015-10-11 20:51:35	spiritfox123	they'll be patching farming so you won't be able to check the growth cycle with OSB at some point
2015-10-11 20:51:42	wizmander	135 ppl for wildy agil grind stream
2015-10-11 20:51:45	wizmander	this is some hype shit bois
2015-10-11 20:51:48	slithz	yeah but mod ash was planning on adding a feature
2015-10-11 20:51:52	slithz	that lets you do that
2015-10-11 20:51:57	spiritfox123	yeah, a lunar spell
2015-10-11 20:51:59	phil7823	well they said if they did that to farming they would have a spell
2015-10-11 20:52:07	hackyx	PogChamp
2015-10-11 20:52:08	slithz	which i think is balanced
2015-10-11 20:52:12	phil7823	and tbh im really hoping phase 1 of zeah reworks farming leveling methods
2015-10-11 20:52:13	slithz	but i have 81 magic on my ironman so
2015-10-11 20:52:13	thmpsn11	how do you train agility for so long without wanting to kill yourself
2015-10-11 20:52:21	spiritfox123	they said they were going to do it regaurdless if the spell passed the poll
2015-10-11 20:52:23	slithz	agility isnt thaaat bad
2015-10-11 20:52:29	optimusprimerib123z	thmpsn agi and music is pretty chill
2015-10-11 20:52:29	phil7823	you really only have to train it one time tbh
2015-10-11 20:52:32	optimusprimerib123z	same with runecrafting tbh
2015-10-11 20:52:38	slithz	runecrafting makes a lot of money
2015-10-11 20:52:41	phil7823	get it to 72 and you are set for a very long time
2015-10-11 20:52:41	slithz	so its a good trade
2015-10-11 20:52:50	ryusensei	runecrafting on ultimate iron FeelsBadMan

2015-10-11 20:54:16	homer__pimpson	seers is slower than wildy iirc
2015-10-11 20:54:17	slithz	w/o kandarin hard
2015-10-11 20:54:26	wizmander	ah, ok, so it's still that way
2015-10-11 20:54:34	wizmander	thought they might have patched it
2015-10-11 20:54:35	phil7823	gotta get those marks though
2015-10-11 20:54:35	slithz	yeah but you do 60-90 agility there
2015-10-11 20:54:38	slithz	with kandarin hard
2015-10-11 20:54:51	homer__pimpson	60-70 more like
2015-10-11 20:54:55	homer__pimpson	who gets 90
2015-10-11 20:54:57	slithz	no 60-90
2015-10-11 20:55:05	slithz	people who want elite diaries
2015-10-11 20:55:05	phil7823	yeah seers 60-90 is the fastest
2015-10-11 20:55:13	homer__pimpson	just making a joke that nobody goes past 70 lol
2015-10-11 20:55:22	slithz	ehhh
2015-10-11 20:55:26	phil7823	people definitely go beyond 70
2015-10-11 20:55:26	slithz	i like shortcuts lol

2015-10-11 20:55:46	slithz	why 72 though lol
2015-10-11 20:55:52	wizmander	regen
2015-10-11 20:55:56	mysticfedora	hiiii :)
2015-10-11 20:55:57	phil7823	72 for sara
2015-10-11 20:56:02	meltsc	Are you saying bad words into a microphone
2015-10-11 20:56:03	slithz	isn't it 70...?
2015-10-11 20:56:04	homer__pimpson	>90% of people who get agility to 70 won't go for 90
2015-10-11 20:56:04	siglemic	you only get a regen upgrade every 6 lvls
2015-10-11 20:56:16	siglemic	i think it's 72
2015-10-11 20:56:20	slithz	well
2015-10-11 20:56:28	slithz	to be fair you shouldnt be doing sara solo on ironman w/o staminas
2015-10-11 20:56:32	slithz	and regen is pointless w/ staminas
2015-10-11 20:56:37	phil7823	true
2015-10-11 20:56:39	siglemic	ok thanks
2015-10-11 20:57:04	homer__pimpson	regen still works while you have staminas though?
2015-10-11 20:57:05	ar_r_ow	this music makes me wanna play some elder scrolls now
2015-10-11 20:57:09	homer__pimpson	Or do you heal more energy than you use?
2015-10-11 20:57:23	phil7823	whats the blue dragon shortcut agi req
2015-10-11 20:57:23	slithz	staminas significantly reduces how much you lose energy
2015-10-11 20:57:29	homer__pimpson	I know how they work
2015-10-11 20:57:29	phil7823	like 80 some ?
2015-10-11 20:57:30	optimusprimerib123z	70 phil
2015-10-11 20:57:34	phil7823	oh really? okay thanks
2015-10-11 20:57:37	mysticfedora	What's the upgrade rate? I read on the 07 wiki today I think you get a single run energy at level 1 agility every 7 seconds and at 50 agility you get one every 4 seconds. Also this song is wonderful.
2015-10-11 20:57:40	slithz	your kg determines how much you lose whilst on the effect of a stamina
2015-10-11 20:57:42	optimusprimerib123z	80 is for a shortcut to black demons i think it is
2015-10-11 20:57:49	slithz	81
2015-10-11 20:57:52	slithz	for falador elite diary
2015-10-11 20:57:56	slithz	its the hellhound shortcut
2015-10-11 20:58:03	homer__pimpson	yeah, but you still regen energy faster with 72 while under the effects of stamina?
2015-10-11 20:58:06	slithz	70 is blue dragon taverly pipe
2015-10-11 20:58:15	slithz	ehh you dont regen while running
2015-10-11 20:58:16	spiritfox123	it's only 80 for the hellhound shorcut
2015-10-11 20:58:18	homer__pimpson	Can't you eat summers pie for the fally elite?
2015-10-11 20:58:22	slithz	and to solo sara you kite around the whole room
2015-10-11 20:58:25	slithz	yes you can Homer
2015-10-11 20:58:28	homer__pimpson	yeah man you do regen while running :\
2015-10-11 20:58:36	homer__pimpson	watch your nrg when running
2015-10-11 20:59:15	homer__pimpson	At least I thought it did. Sometimes it looks like it takes longer to go down by 1 than other times
2015-10-11 20:59:15	slithz	doesnt matter tho 72 wont make a difference at sara
2015-10-11 20:59:34	slithz	you need staminas to solo otherwise you get smushed
2015-10-11 20:59:38	phil7823	72 for the shortcut though
2015-10-11 20:59:42	slithz	its 70
2015-10-11 20:59:48	meltsc	Sig you've probably been asked 100 times already, but are you planning on going to AGDQ?
2015-10-11 20:59:56	spiritfox123	72 is for nieve's cave shorcut
2015-10-11 20:59:56	slithz	70 str, range, str, agility for the gwd entrances
2015-10-11 21:00:27	slithz	yeah 72 is the nieve Nech's shortcut
2015-10-11 21:00:57	siglemic	oh yeah
2015-10-11 21:01:02	siglemic	was going to eat lol
2015-10-11 21:01:07	ryusensei	rip soup BibleThump
2015-10-11 21:01:14	spiritfox123	lol

2015-10-11 21:01:24	ablaij	can't stop the gains
2015-10-11 21:01:27	phil7823	can ironmans use blast furnace?
2015-10-11 21:01:32	spiritfox123	i think so
2015-10-11 21:01:38	ablaij	yes
2015-10-11 21:01:39	ishtinmypants	Yes
2015-10-11 21:01:44	spiritfox123	i know ironmen can't do fishing trawler
2015-10-11 21:01:46	phil7823	hell yeah, thanks
2015-10-11 21:02:28	mysticfedora	shigetta miyamoto
2015-10-11 21:02:54	spiritfox123	i made like 750k doing fishing trawler for the angler outfit lol

2015-10-11 22:30:41	ablaij	the zulrah life chose me OpieOP
2015-10-11 22:30:56	s1ight3d	I thought it was always faster for blast furnace because of the ability to stack all those bars at once
2015-10-11 22:31:08	kiburedokibu	I wonder if they're ever going to nerf zulrah gp/hr lol
2015-10-11 22:31:19	s1ight3d	and the amount of time you spend running is cut drastically by the coal cost reduction
2015-10-11 22:31:35	s1ight3d	but, hum. I'd have to look at it more keenly to know, I guess.
2015-10-11 22:31:46	phil7823	bf is always faster im p sure
2015-10-11 22:31:49	gzo852	if you're doing mith or higher you pretty much need a coal bag though
2015-10-11 22:32:08	phil7823	yeah but if youre smithing mith you should have the coal bag if you are an ironman
2015-10-11 22:32:20	phil7823	normally by that time i guess
2015-10-11 22:32:26	25498	this is like runescape but without all the great content and improved combat systems
2015-10-11 22:32:41	siglemic	no trolling please

2015-10-11 22:33:17	s1ight3d	lmao
2015-10-11 22:33:31	s1ight3d	that link was...low quality bait then, I guess Kappa

2015-10-11 22:34:43	kiburedokibu	Oh nvm lawl, deaths went up a bit
2015-10-11 22:35:33	kiburedokibu	I always wondered, is cammy tele'ing still good magic exp?
2015-10-11 22:35:50	phil7823	its pretty fast
2015-10-11 22:35:51	25498	on OS? I guess so
2015-10-11 22:36:05	phil7823	if you can afford it, one of the fastest methods
2015-10-11 22:36:08	kiburedokibu	I just really need 70 magic, lol
2015-10-11 22:36:48	gzo852	alch/curse imo
2015-10-11 22:37:06	25498	Man I got 99 magic by alching
2015-10-11 22:37:07	kiburedokibu	See how ugly it is? lol http://puu.sh/kH6i9/6b53272f58.png
2015-10-11 22:37:08	gzo852	alching is cheaper than cammy teleporting
2015-10-11 22:37:08	25498	took forever
2015-10-11 22:38:14	25498	I wonder if that other guy was autoclicking cause don't bots pass random events?
2015-10-11 22:38:15	gzo852	lol 25498 i used to think alching was the only method to train magic properly
2015-10-11 22:38:48	25498	lmao, worst part is I did it on RS3
2015-10-11 22:39:07	kiburedokibu	That's just sad as fuck
2015-10-11 22:39:12	kiburedokibu	xD
2015-10-11 22:39:16	trulyoutrageous	Where can I find this music? it's oddly soothing.
2015-10-11 22:39:17	rainbowess	The mental fortitude you have sig is commendable, I just came back after a few hours. XD
2015-10-11 22:39:21	gzo852	cant you actually make money by alching in rs3
2015-10-11 22:39:27	25498	yeah made like
2015-10-11 22:39:30	25498	40m or something

2015-10-11 22:39:35	25498	but still farm from worth it
2015-10-11 22:39:40	kiburedokibu	None of your business, Sighted.
2015-10-11 22:39:43	kiburedokibu	...14, lol
2015-10-11 22:39:44	squidifications	The song is listed at the top.
2015-10-11 22:39:46	s1ight3d	...rekky
2015-10-11 22:39:57	25498	the good thing is that with mousekeys it's just spamming 1 button
2015-10-11 22:40:01	s1ight3d	I hate the thought of Camelot teleporting for mage exp
2015-10-11 22:40:08	s1ight3d	I was gonna say you should make teletab
2015-10-11 22:40:11	s1ight3d	*teletabs
2015-10-11 22:40:18	kiburedokibu	Ahh yeah no, I can't yet :(
2015-10-11 22:40:27	kiburedokibu	But I'm getting laws via Ankous, so eh
2015-10-11 22:40:30	s1ight3d	Same mage exp, just takes a little more time(Is a snap if you have house tele/glory in house)
2015-10-11 22:40:41	s1ight3d	Well, you can do House Party world
2015-10-11 22:40:50	s1ight3d	That's how I make my house tabs until I'm 67
2015-10-11 22:41:07	s1ight3d	And getting 50 cons for glory in house is not expensive if you make your own planks
2015-10-11 22:41:19	kiburedokibu	I'm just lazy, lol
2015-10-11 22:42:12	deboogs	Sig plays Runescape what?
2015-10-11 22:42:19	kiburedokibu	Sig plays Runescape who?
2015-10-11 22:42:38	s1ight3d	I'm also lazy, which is why I'm not making my oak planks and watching this stream
2015-10-11 22:42:47	deboogs	:P
2015-10-11 22:42:49	s1ight3d	but I do like to do things self-sufficiently more often than not
2015-10-11 22:43:17	kiburedokibu	Yep, gonna get 44 rc when I can, only 37 atm, but it's so slow, eh lol
2015-10-11 22:43:26	gzo852	its so much more rewarding that way @S1ight3d
2015-10-11 22:43:30	deboogs	Oh man. That Waterfall Quest 30 attack strength.
2015-10-11 22:43:33	s1ight3d	Abyss makes it much liveable
2015-10-11 22:43:35	phil7823	it really is
2015-10-11 22:43:36	kiburedokibu	And then 65 fletching to 70, so I can make yew longs for a massive profit

2015-10-11 22:44:00	s1ight3d	and yeah, it's good money
2015-10-11 22:44:18	s1ight3d	I have like 1300 yew logs that'll pay for my 1.05m to get 67 cons for eagle lectern
2015-10-11 22:44:22	kiburedokibu	Ankous great money for combat training, so I'm addicted on that atm lol
2015-10-11 22:44:28	s1ight3d	I am sad that gold ore when up so much
2015-10-11 22:44:36	s1ight3d	Slayer=best combattu trainu
2015-10-11 22:44:36	kiburedokibu	Oh yeah I know...
2015-10-11 22:44:56	kiburedokibu	I loved making gold bracelets, and now it's money loss
2015-10-11 22:45:01	s1ight3d	I like the minute profit from buying gold ore, pess, and then just alching the braceys
2015-10-11 22:45:03	deboogs	Is buying Yew Longs on GE and then alching them freeish magic exp? I remember back in 07 it was like that.
2015-10-11 22:45:16	s1ight3d	but with gold ore+pess currently above 330, it's a loss now :<
2015-10-11 22:45:20	gzo852	i made like 4m buying gold ore form the shop in jatiszo and selling it back
2015-10-11 22:45:28	s1ight3d	ooh
2015-10-11 22:45:39	gzo852	it gets hard though because theres like 300 bots doing it too
2015-10-11 22:45:42	s1ight3d	I remember making money on trading sticks last year lol
2015-10-11 22:46:17	s1ight3d	But, I'm still riding on my 99 fishing money and trying to slowly climb to 30m while still skilling
2015-10-11 22:46:30	s1ight3d	farming is also GREAT money
2015-10-11 22:46:41	gzo852	yeah herb runs are nice
2015-10-11 22:46:41	kiburedokibu	My main goal is the abby dagger lol, but hoping it drops a lot soon
2015-10-11 22:46:43	s1ight3d	irit and toadflax are ez $$
2015-10-11 22:46:50	s1ight3d	And every herb seed is profit anyways
2015-10-11 22:46:55	gzo852	irit and toadflax wut
2015-10-11 22:47:01	gzo852	ranarr/snapdragon is most profit arent they
2015-10-11 22:47:03	s1ight3d	They're mega cheap seeds
2015-10-11 22:47:22	ablaij	he wants you to grow herb for him
2015-10-11 22:47:29	s1ight3d	irit seeds are like ~60gp and herbs are ~1k toadlfax seeds are like ~150 and herbs are like 2k

2015-10-11 22:48:12	siglemic	so not that close
2015-10-11 22:48:12	kiburedokibu	I think I've only made like... 1.5m for a few days at ankous... thinking back, that's bad money... but STILL xD
2015-10-11 22:48:14	siglemic	but ill get tomorrow
2015-10-11 22:48:37	gzo852	sighted, ranarr seed = 27k, ranarr = 7.5k. at minimum of 5 herbs per patch you get 10k profit, but most of the time i avg 7 per patch
2015-10-11 22:48:39	hhn24	Nice
2015-10-11 22:49:45	s1ight3d	I usually pick things I can buy in bulk and not murder my cash stack with
2015-10-11 22:50:01	gzo852	lol true
2015-10-11 22:50:07	sin_of_wrath	*starts watching Siglemic* *Chill music out of nowhere playing over Runescape* I don't know what this is but I like it
2015-10-11 22:50:09	s1ight3d	So yeah, ranarrs are better profit, I suppose. But, I stick to the cheap stuff because less people go for it
2015-10-11 22:50:10	kiburedokibu	While I'm sitting here with 18 farming. lol
2015-10-11 22:50:17	gerfiti	ever just examine the same object 5 times in a row
2015-10-11 22:50:25	s1ight3d	18 farming will be ez to get high fast breh
2015-10-11 22:50:31	s1ight3d	Acorns are cheap again Kreygasm
2015-10-11 22:50:38	s1ight3d	I need to start doing tree runs
2015-10-11 22:50:49	kiburedokibu	Lol I did that one quest with 1 farming...
2015-10-11 22:50:49	gzo852	farming is so confusing when you dont know how to do it
2015-10-11 22:50:51	gerfiti	do sum quests to get farming up, a few good ones skip you a while
2015-10-11 22:50:52	kiburedokibu	That took forever.
2015-10-11 22:50:54	s1ight3d	I haven't done ANY in OSRS, and my farming level is catching up to Pre-EOC
2015-10-11 22:51:12	s1ight3d	I had level 1 farming until like 2008 or something
2015-10-11 22:51:52	archadon	99 agi the goal?

2015-10-11 22:52:41	kiburedokibu	Wonder if it'd be worth it melee'ing blue drags instead of ankous
2015-10-11 22:52:58	kiburedokibu	(I have 70 agility, so... ) lol
2015-10-11 22:53:41	gzo852	why not do slayer
2015-10-11 22:53:54	kiburedokibu	Because it feels like my melee isn't good enough for slayer yet.
2015-10-11 22:54:02	kiburedokibu	Fire giants hitting annoyingly accurate, etc.
2015-10-11 22:54:13	gzo852	you should be able to do slayer at any level
2015-10-11 22:54:19	gzo852	just go to the right slayer master
2015-10-11 22:54:21	nox_7	whooooa what did i just walk in on

2015-10-11 22:58:55	gzo852	unless you pray flick
2015-10-11 22:58:56	s1ight3d	You should try prayer flicking yo

2015-10-11 22:59:11	s1ight3d	the drops are more than worth the food
2015-10-11 22:59:21	s1ight3d	I do only have 71 def though
2015-10-11 22:59:26	phil7823	oh god prayer flicking.. gonna be the bane of my life

2015-10-11 23:03:10	s1ight3d	I just don't wanna drop the mad cash pile it'll cost to do so
2015-10-11 23:03:26	s1ight3d	I wouldn't spend time training combat on non slayer
2015-10-11 23:03:28	kiburedokibu	Eh it's not as bad as it used to be
2015-10-11 23:03:28	gzo852	you should level whatever sounds fun phil

2015-10-11 23:19:28	phil7823	first thing i did on my acc was get a ton of arrows and then do pc until full void
2015-10-11 23:19:35	s1ight3d	I did my void grind back when the exp was still stunted in the minigame :v
2015-10-11 23:19:39	kiburedokibu	I wouldn't be able to quest with iron man, I'd go insane lol
2015-10-11 23:19:41	phil7823	ended with 61 range and about 200k cash
2015-10-11 23:19:47	s1ight3d	I like PC, it's fun to do it fast
2015-10-11 23:19:54	s1ight3d	and now I could like dharok on the portals for fun too
2015-10-11 23:19:54	gzo852	its all about broad bolts phil
2015-10-11 23:19:59	s1ight3d	broads Kreygasm
2015-10-11 23:20:01	kiburedokibu	Is PC world always full on players for PC?
2015-10-11 23:20:08	phil7823	well, im making mith bolts lol
2015-10-11 23:20:09	kriptog92	Going to 70 agil?
2015-10-11 23:20:14	s1ight3d	The PC world will always be passable
2015-10-11 23:20:17	phil7823	ill have 10k so.. i guess ill just use them up first
2015-10-11 23:20:41	cardimum	72 Kriptog92
2015-10-11 23:21:07	gzo852	barbarian assault is definitely the worst minigame though
2015-10-11 23:21:14	kiburedokibu	I still have never done it
2015-10-11 23:21:26	phil7823	is there any reason for an ironman to do that mini game
2015-10-11 23:21:27	s1ight3d	Barb Assault can be done speedily just fine
2015-10-11 23:21:35	kiburedokibu	Torso, Phil
2015-10-11 23:21:36	ablaij	for torso and diary
2015-10-11 23:21:37	bloodhype	torso or penance gloves
2015-10-11 23:21:38	kiburedokibu	Torso always good.
2015-10-11 23:21:40	gzo852	yeah its not a problem with the game its the people
2015-10-11 23:21:40	s1ight3d	I just am terrible at Defender and want a competent team so that it goes fast
2015-10-11 23:21:52	s1ight3d	I want to get level 5 classes before my torso
2015-10-11 23:22:22	s1ight3d	which is stupid because I should have gotten my torso ages ago but blah
2015-10-11 23:22:31	gzo852	i got penance gloves and i dont want to go back for torso
2015-10-11 23:22:37	kiburedokibu	I'll just stick with rune pl8 until bandos lol
2015-10-11 23:22:48	bloodhype	use rockshell. much cooler
2015-10-11 23:22:53	kiburedokibu	Actually using dharoks atm tbh
2015-10-11 23:23:07	s1ight3d	I use D Legs and Verac Brassy >_>'
2015-10-11 23:23:13	s1ight3d	for melee tasks, at least
2015-10-11 23:23:18	s1ight3d	Well, non dhide melee tasks
2015-10-11 23:23:20	kiburedokibu	Brassy is pretty damn sexy.
2015-10-11 23:23:24	kiburedokibu	But I don't like dragon armor
2015-10-11 23:23:24	duodenumofficial	Use granite pl8 Kappa
2015-10-11 23:23:27	s1ight3d	plus pray bonuz
2015-10-11 23:23:35	s1ight3d	granite pl8 DansGame
2015-10-11 23:23:45	s1ight3d	I like dragon armour
2015-10-11 23:23:51	kiburedokibu	Granite pl8 was ruined after the fucking new bot armor set.
2015-10-11 23:23:54	s1ight3d	wish sq wasn't pointless :(
2015-10-11 23:24:07	kiburedokibu	I think the obby shield is pretty sexy though
2015-10-11 23:24:09	gzo852	dragon sq Kreygasm
2015-10-11 23:24:14	s1ight3d	I just can't use not defender
2015-10-11 23:24:15	kiburedokibu	Defender > Obby shield however
2015-10-11 23:24:18	gzo852	still need to get one in classic
2015-10-11 23:24:19	bloodhype	best shield imo is crystal
2015-10-11 23:24:23	kiburedokibu	I love my ddef to death
2015-10-11 23:24:25	s1ight3d	defender is so nice
2015-10-11 23:24:35	s1ight3d	OSRS dragon defender is so satisfying
2015-10-11 23:24:44	s1ight3d	it's way more in line with the old style items
2015-10-11 23:24:45	kiburedokibu	I still want a DFS though
2015-10-11 23:24:50	luciencren	lol i remember the days like when d sq was best, legends cape was the best cape and liek a status symbol <.<
2015-10-11 23:24:57	s1ight3d	the pre-eoc ddef was just...too different
2015-10-11 23:25:07	s1ight3d	I was still a noob in those days, lucien
2015-10-11 23:25:36	kiburedokibu	Sweet they dropped a str potion, useful
2015-10-11 23:25:36	bloodhype	remember when klanks gauntlents were the best gloves in the game?
2015-10-11 23:26:05	s1ight3d	Underground Pass DansGame
2015-10-11 23:26:17	gzo852	they actually had the same stats as the family crest gloves
2015-10-11 23:27:09	dawngo	Are you going to play deadman mode if it ever gets released
2015-10-11 23:27:17	kiburedokibu	What about the combat bracelet? ehh lol
2015-10-11 23:27:52	keosis	So what is going on here?
2015-10-11 23:28:04	zarakian9	i feel like hes getting super sick exp
2015-10-11 23:28:15	troydabeast	whats the goals for the ironman sofar
2015-10-11 23:28:24	phil7823	get the foundation going
2015-10-11 23:28:25	phil7823	base stats
2015-10-11 23:30:03	s1ight3d	combat bracelet is okay until you get RFD gloves
2015-10-11 23:30:22	s1ight3d	also, for ironmen early, spiky dhide vambs are good too
2015-10-11 23:30:36	s1ight3d	pretty sure the kebbits with spikes aren't too far in hunter
2015-10-11 23:30:58	kiburedokibu	Yeah I need to do RFD for barrows, but ehhhh
2015-10-11 23:31:08	gzo852	getting barrows gloves is too annoying, i just use klanks lol
2015-10-11 23:31:29	kiburedokibu	Why not buy a combat bracelet? Unless Iron Man, lol
2015-10-11 23:31:40	gzo852	is it better
2015-10-11 23:32:04	kiburedokibu	Has a lot more attack bonus
2015-10-11 23:32:17	kiburedokibu	http://2007.runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Combat_bracelet
2015-10-11 23:32:23	s1ight3d	Is a dstone brace hard for ironmen to get though?
2015-10-11 23:32:34	kiburedokibu	Well honestly not really.
2015-10-11 23:32:38	gzo852	feel like crystal key isnt that hard
2015-10-11 23:32:45	kiburedokibu	Crystal Key + Goldsmithing
2015-10-11 23:32:47	gzo852	crafting is the hard part
2015-10-11 23:32:49	kiburedokibu	And then crafting, etc.
2015-10-11 23:32:50	s1ight3d	Well, the crafting level to make it
2015-10-11 23:32:50	phil7823	getting high grafting
2015-10-11 23:32:56	phil7823	is really annoying
2015-10-11 23:33:02	kiburedokibu	True... forgot how high it was.
2015-10-11 23:33:04	phil7823	buy 483 billion soda ash and sand
2015-10-11 23:33:04	s1ight3d	It's not like implings where you can just get an uncharged dstone ammy
2015-10-11 23:33:25	tornwulf	is there no one on this world?
2015-10-11 23:33:29	tornwulf	like what?
2015-10-11 23:33:46	s1ight3d	I have seen white dots
2015-10-11 23:33:55	s1ight3d	Also, you can filter your game messages, Sig
2015-10-11 23:33:59	tornwulf	there is 1
2015-10-11 23:34:32	gzo852	yeah thats probably the best way to do it phil
2015-10-11 23:34:48	gzo852	make glass orbs for battlestaves when you get there
2015-10-11 23:34:54	phil7823	yeah its going to suck lol
2015-10-11 23:35:11	phil7823	really not looking forward todoing that, maybe ill do it over a long time with dhides or smth
2015-10-11 23:35:30	tornwulf	looks like you did waterfall quest already
2015-10-11 23:35:54	gzo852	or just do combat and do zulrah
2015-10-11 23:35:58	gzo852	conveniently drops 1k noted flax
2015-10-11 23:36:20	phil7823	if i get to that point before i find another method, then yeah
2015-10-11 23:36:33	s1ight3d	and getting flax is not bad once you have finished Roving Elves
2015-10-11 23:36:47	s1ight3d	but..at that point, Zulrah is probably soon for you
2015-10-11 23:37:09	gzo852	or just be a true iron man and do it with 0 zulrah killcount
2015-10-11 23:37:28	kiburedokibu	Alright, lets see how much money that one fire giant trip made me... (without crystal key piece)
2015-10-11 23:37:56	kiburedokibu	27k, lol
2015-10-11 23:38:04	phil7823	ive heard ranged is not good for slayer, is that true?
2015-10-11 23:38:15	s1ight3d	27k eyyy
2015-10-11 23:38:15	kiburedokibu	Ranged is very good for slayer, imo
2015-10-11 23:38:16	phil7823	i want to use mith bolts when training is that bad lol
2015-10-11 23:38:30	s1ight3d	That trip was only a portion of your task though yeah?
2015-10-11 23:38:30	gzo852	depends on the task but its a good way to train ranged
2015-10-11 23:38:35	teamb33r	sound?
2015-10-11 23:38:45	s1ight3d	It's perfectly good until you unlock broads, Phil
2015-10-11 23:39:00	phil7823	like what task should i not do with ranged?
2015-10-11 23:39:03	s1ight3d	What's your RSN so I can check your stats, Phil?
2015-10-11 23:39:04	kiburedokibu	Alright, please don't fuck me crystal key
2015-10-11 23:39:10	phil7823	Iron Catbear
2015-10-11 23:39:22	gzo852	i mean if you feel like you're using too much food or if you want to train melee then just do that
2015-10-11 23:39:23	s1ight3d	Crystal key is always a dstone, so it's hard for it to screw you over lol
2015-10-11 23:39:29	bloodhype	what slayer master are you using phil
2015-10-11 23:39:31	gzo852	but ranged is just so useful that training slayer with it is worth it
2015-10-11 23:39:51	phil7823	i got a killerwatts task from vannicka and got wrecked
2015-10-11 23:39:53	kiburedokibu	Yup, don't have to use as much food with ranged
2015-10-11 23:40:00	teamb33r	seriously where the sound?
2015-10-11 23:40:01	killfacee	so I just tuned in, what are we doin'?
2015-10-11 23:40:01	phil7823	and i still have to kill like 50, but i ran out of ammo
2015-10-11 23:40:02	s1ight3d	I would say get 70 agility and grind out some blue dragons, Phil
2015-10-11 23:40:15	phil7823	hell yeah, thank you guys for the suggestions
2015-10-11 23:40:27	kiburedokibu	Just don't go crazy trying to get it
2015-10-11 23:40:33	kiburedokibu	Some people who do agility, unlike Sig, go nuts
2015-10-11 23:40:42	s1ight3d	with 70 agility, taverly dungeon blue dragon banking takes ~1min from tele to back at drags
2015-10-11 23:40:52	phil7823	idk, im alrdy 61 so itll only be like session
2015-10-11 23:40:55	cardimum	sig was nutty to start with Kappa
2015-10-11 23:40:56	phil7823	1 session *
2015-10-11 23:40:56	bloodhype	its ridiculous how quick you can get thieving up but agil takes so much longer
2015-10-11 23:41:28	phil7823	should i bury bones on spot?
2015-10-11 23:41:29	s1ight3d	Ironmen can't use others' houses, right?
2015-10-11 23:41:33	s1ight3d	Save bones
2015-10-11 23:41:37	s1ight3d	Ectofuntus
2015-10-11 23:41:41	s1ight3d	????
2015-10-11 23:41:42	s1ight3d	profit
2015-10-11 23:41:43	kiburedokibu	Save them until you can use Ectoectoectoecto
2015-10-11 23:41:45	phil7823	yeah we cant use gildeds
2015-10-11 23:41:47	rinku249	wow siglemic on runescape.... Hello Guys Kappa /
2015-10-11 23:41:49	phil7823	oh yeah the ectofunctus okay
2015-10-11 23:41:57	s1ight3d	Well, you can use your own altar once you're 50 cons
2015-10-11 23:41:57	hamzakhurram	why is he leleling agility first on an ironman (i'm new to rs)
2015-10-11 23:42:03	hamzakhurram	leveling*
2015-10-11 23:42:10	s1ight3d	He's gonna be doing lots of running
2015-10-11 23:42:11	kiburedokibu	Because Agility is really really useful
2015-10-11 23:42:17	phil7823	wait gilded altar is only 50 con??
2015-10-11 23:42:26	buttsoap	it makes training other skills more efficient
2015-10-11 23:42:27	s1ight3d	nonono
2015-10-11 23:42:30	buttsoap	like rc
2015-10-11 23:42:40	s1ight3d	50 cons is really important for: Glory In House/Teleport room
2015-10-11 23:42:53	kiburedokibu	Gilded is 75 bro
2015-10-11 23:42:55	s1ight3d	Glory in house = Kreygasm for ironmen
2015-10-11 23:42:57	hamzakhurram	Thank you.
2015-10-11 23:42:58	phil7823	i need to get 83 hunter for my glorys
2015-10-11 23:43:05	s1ight3d	You can boost for gilded as well
2015-10-11 23:43:16	s1ight3d	if you luck out on stews lol
2015-10-11 23:43:18	gzo852	i used to think mounted glory was good for non iron man
2015-10-11 23:43:20	kiburedokibu	Oh, I got the runes crystal key drop
2015-10-11 23:43:28	gzo852	then just bought 40 glories and called it a day
2015-10-11 23:43:33	s1ight3d	I use glory in house for a lot of things
2015-10-11 23:43:37	s1ight3d	like farm runs and clues
2015-10-11 23:43:49	phil7823	glory in house is infinite uses right?
2015-10-11 23:43:53	s1ight3d	yes
2015-10-11 23:43:57	phil7823	nice ok
2015-10-11 23:44:08	kiburedokibu	Are scrolls of redirect in osrs? I forget
2015-10-11 23:44:10	s1ight3d	For runecrafting, having a pile of glories is smarter lol
2015-10-11 23:44:14	s1ight3d	Yes, they are
2015-10-11 23:44:18	s1ight3d	NMZ shop though

2015-10-11 23:46:48	1kamikaze	why are you not buying the graceful set
2015-10-11 23:46:49	kiburedokibu	That would be iron drag iirc?
2015-10-11 23:47:06	gzo852	steel
2015-10-11 23:47:12	gzo852	or no iron nvm
2015-10-11 23:47:19	kiburedokibu	Yup, get owned via wiki, bro

2015-10-11 23:47:50	kiburedokibu	Does seem a little scary for an iron man

2015-10-11 23:48:27	s1ight3d	antifire+anti shield=ez, but takes forever if low ranged
2015-10-11 23:48:37	phil7823	yeah im only 61 range
2015-10-11 23:48:38	s1ight3d	range/mage I guess

2015-10-11 23:48:44	s1ight3d	61 isn't too bad
2015-10-11 23:48:54	gzo852	doubt hes gonna have antifires by then
2015-10-11 23:48:57	gzo852	unless theres some other way to get them
2015-10-11 23:49:24	kiburedokibu	Hhn, do as I did, cut yews for them
2015-10-11 23:49:33	phil7823	wait cant i use a cbow with an antifire shield

2015-10-11 23:49:39	gzo852	antifire potion
2015-10-11 23:49:44	kiburedokibu	But dragonfire will still hit through
2015-10-11 23:49:46	gzo852	makes them hit 0
2015-10-11 23:49:47	kiburedokibu	A tiny bit
2015-10-11 23:50:05	phil7823	i see
2015-10-11 23:51:37	kiburedokibu	Ugh how rare is it to get a perfect dds spec? lol
2015-10-11 23:51:52	phil7823	depends on your max hit
2015-10-11 23:52:18	kiburedokibu	Is there a max command in osbuddy?
2015-10-11 23:52:33	optimusprimerib123z	if you go to the equipment screen it tells you
2015-10-11 23:52:41	optimusprimerib123z	in the top left of the menu
2015-10-11 23:52:42	kiburedokibu	Ohrly
2015-10-11 23:52:44	phil7823	i think you can just bring up equip
2015-10-11 23:52:48	kiburedokibu	Oh that's cool
2015-10-11 23:53:00	kiburedokibu	Max with dds is 24, 25 with scimi, meh
2015-10-11 23:53:11	kiburedokibu	Slayer helm ftw
2015-10-11 23:53:12	phil7823	and then you calculate the mobs defense, with all of your combat stats and the max hit
2015-10-11 23:53:28	kiburedokibu	Math I have to DO? Fkkkk :P
2015-10-11 23:53:30	phil7823	tldr its pretty rare with all things considered, moreso with higher levels of gear and stats
2015-10-11 23:53:57	s1ight3d	Also, scim is going to hit more than dds because of attack values, unless whatever you're fighting is way weak to stab(because using dagger for not stab is...odd)
2015-10-11 23:54:14	kiburedokibu	Yeah I only use dds for spec, lol
2015-10-11 23:54:19	kiburedokibu	Until I get abyssal dagger, hnnng
2015-10-11 23:54:33	s1ight3d	also, max hits are...extremely rare. You know how RNG is, lol
2015-10-11 23:55:01	kiburedokibu	I hate that the dragon dagger is pointed forward in RS3, it's so damn iconic for it to be backwards.
2015-10-11 23:55:03	phil7823	esp when you have a really high max hit lol
2015-10-11 23:55:42	phil7823	yo sig how much longer you going to stream man?
2015-10-11 23:55:54	siglemic	idk
2015-10-11 23:56:05	phil7823	i need to work on my falcon but don't want to leave haha
2015-10-11 23:56:35	s1ight3d	I need to just get motivated to practice melee again >_<
2015-10-11 23:56:47	phil7823	idk why but recently i started playing with rumble
2015-10-11 23:56:47	kiburedokibu	I just need to buy a gamecube, and the game, lol.
2015-10-11 23:56:49	s1ight3d	I was just starting to learn and then I fell off the track again
2015-10-11 23:57:01	s1ight3d	I finally bought a copy after APEX(rip)
2015-10-11 23:57:01	phil7823	and my skill just shot through the roof somehow
2015-10-11 23:57:17	s1ight3d	I need to get basic tech skill and consistency in movement down
2015-10-11 23:57:20	s1ight3d	plus tilts and stuff
2015-10-11 23:57:22	adagissimo	when did this ironman start?
2015-10-11 23:57:25	gzo852	rumble is good to know when hitstun ends
2015-10-11 23:57:30	kiburedokibu	Few days ago
2015-10-11 23:57:32	siglemic	yesterday
2015-10-11 23:57:37	phil7823	i normally just play on 1 player and move around spamming tech
2015-10-11 23:57:37	kiburedokibu	Or.. yesterday?
2015-10-11 23:57:41	kiburedokibu	I thought it was 2 days ago
2015-10-11 23:57:45	kiburedokibu	Man my sleeping is fuckeeed
2015-10-11 23:58:05	s1ight3d	I was gonna try to get 20xx so I could do training mode and have c-stick and all that
2015-10-11 23:58:30	phil7823	like if you cant hit all of your Lcancels then no point to really work on combo game imo
2015-10-11 23:58:42	s1ight3d	Yeah. I just need consistency in general
2015-10-11 23:58:52	phil7823	word me too, my ledge game is pretty weak
2015-10-11 23:59:02	phil7823	trying to get moonwalk > ledge and haxdashing down
2015-10-11 23:59:05	s1ight3d	I still can't consistently SHFFL so yeah, that tells you my skill level lol
2015-10-11 23:59:13	phil7823	well just keep at it
2015-10-11 23:59:19	phil7823	youll be surprised how fast you can improve
2015-10-11 23:59:28	s1ight3d	Yeah, I was surprised when I first tried
2015-10-11 23:59:31	phil7823	and it just keeps getting more fun from there
2015-10-11 23:59:40	gzo852	good thing about shffling is once you get it you never forget how to do it
2015-10-11 23:59:46	gzo852	same with l cancelling and a lot of things
2015-10-11 23:59:48	s1ight3d	It took me 4 hours to get wavedashing down, but it's all consistency from the first learning
2015-10-11 23:59:51	phil7823	becomes second nature
2015-10-12 00:00:06	phil7823	you don't even think about l cancelling unless you plan for a lot of hitlag
2015-10-12 00:00:20	s1ight3d	I am lucky for being a fresh-ish slate as well, so I have been trying to start with good habits
2015-10-12 00:00:30	phil7823	what char you play ?
2015-10-12 00:00:36	s1ight3d	Luigi x:
2015-10-12 00:00:39	phil7823	LOL
2015-10-12 00:00:41	gzo852	props
2015-10-12 00:00:43	phil7823	fk yeah man that is awesome
2015-10-12 00:01:05	s1ight3d	I dunno, I just always liked his style, and with good tech skill, it just looks even more fun
2015-10-12 00:01:18	phil7823	luigi is one of the strongest low tiers for sure
2015-10-12 00:01:26	s1ight3d	Plus I have learned all these subtle things like the down B thing
2015-10-12 00:01:26	phil7823	abate beats top tier players all the time with him
2015-10-12 00:01:28	gzo852	luigi can run over people
2015-10-12 00:01:42	phil7823	luigi is a monster, and for a lot of characters hes hard to combo
2015-10-12 00:01:47	s1ight3d	and his ledgedash is so nice since he's floaty
2015-10-12 00:01:50	gzo852	you get all the practice against top tiers and they get no practice vs luigi so its nice
2015-10-12 00:01:51	phil7823	hes so hard for me as falcon
2015-10-12 00:02:09	phil7823	you always have the matchup knowledge advantage for the most part
2015-10-12 00:02:16	s1ight3d	I was gonna 2ndary with Marth, but I want to get one character down first
2015-10-12 00:02:26	phil7823	good ide
2015-10-12 00:02:31	s1ight3d	there's enough videos for me to study a lot at this point too
2015-10-12 00:02:35	phil7823	imo marth not the best for beginners
2015-10-12 00:02:40	phil7823	dude watch abate
2015-10-12 00:02:44	s1ight3d	Oh, I do lol
2015-10-12 00:02:50	phil7823	abate, vudujin, eddy mexico
2015-10-12 00:02:58	gzo852	marth is like the easiest character
2015-10-12 00:03:01	phil7823	vist also p good
2015-10-12 00:03:01	gzo852	next to sheik
2015-10-12 00:03:03	gzo852	imo
2015-10-12 00:03:12	s1ight3d	I've watched tournaments for ages now. My work schedule stopped me from going to the monthly like 2 months after I started, but things have changed again
2015-10-12 00:03:21	phil7823	oh okay right on
2015-10-12 00:03:29	s1ight3d	and my area seems to be good for looking for others to help me as well

2015-10-12 00:03:58	phil7823	my college has a decent program but if im the best player by far then its not competitive lol

2015-10-12 00:08:27	s1ight3d	but for most part I just do NES/Wii/PC
2015-10-12 00:08:50	s1ight3d	I need to get my stuff so that I can stream better quality though and get back to actually beating my NES games
2015-10-12 00:09:12	s1ight3d	and tbh I should be getting those dumb planks for my construction in RS too lol

2015-10-12 14:26:04	culocuddles	o_o
2015-10-12 14:26:04	truespcb	siglemic is unfortunatley not a god
2015-10-12 14:26:13	truespcb	so the man needs food
2015-10-12 14:26:35	culocuddles	oh please, he only stopped for food so he can give it to the poor
2015-10-12 14:26:43	culocuddles	what a kind hearted god
2015-10-12 14:27:07	siglemic	was starting to feel the jitters cuz coffee no food

2015-10-12 14:27:41	siglemic	banger
2015-10-12 14:27:59	truespcb	agreed
2015-10-12 14:28:05	siglemic	chapter 7
2015-10-12 14:28:08	siglemic	has the hot songs
2015-10-12 14:28:36	truespcb	feels strange to me that i played this game 6 years ago now
2015-10-12 14:28:49	siglemic	ye i played when it came out w/ translation guide lol
2015-10-12 14:29:02	siglemic	then the eng patch was like Kreygasm
2015-10-12 14:29:08	truespcb	was too young for that
2015-10-12 14:29:35	lakilester5626	I tried to get the WC cape once. I got to 88, then I realized what I was doing with my life.
2015-10-12 14:29:40	truespcb	didn't even know the internet was a thing until 2007ish
2015-10-12 14:30:01	siglemic	that is just your mind sabotaging you, ruining your gains
2015-10-12 14:30:19	lakilester5626	Dear Lord, forgive me for these gains I'm about to make.
2015-10-12 14:30:27	culocuddles	pretty much started using the internet around the time gaia online.com came out 2004ish
2015-10-12 14:30:38	cardimum	Kreygasm GAINS Kreygasm
2015-10-12 14:31:43	truespcb	listened to this ost the other day
2015-10-12 14:31:47	truespcb	forgot how good it was
2015-10-12 14:31:58	siglemic	it has some bland stuff
2015-10-12 14:32:05	siglemic	but the good parts are Kreygasm
2015-10-12 14:32:08	truespcb	yeah
2015-10-12 14:33:59	lakilester5626	I know the rules, but may I ask a quick question about sm64?
2015-10-12 14:34:14	siglemic	ya
2015-10-12 14:35:00	magikilo	never played a mother game.. am i missing out
2015-10-12 14:35:05	lakilester5626	the WR now is about three minutes faster. How much of that is optimization, and how much is just a cleaner run, do you think?
2015-10-12 14:35:17	truespcb	yes mag
2015-10-12 14:35:21	andrick11x	I would say so, yes Magikilo
2015-10-12 14:35:23	luigi811	the chillest music
2015-10-12 14:35:25	siglemic	my pb sucked by my standards when i got it
2015-10-12 14:35:36	truespcb	i still need to play earthbound
2015-10-12 14:35:39	lakilester5626	Oh yeah, I remember.
2015-10-12 14:35:45	siglemic	was kind of on my way out w/ the game when puncay was coming in
2015-10-12 14:35:51	siglemic	had no motivation and played like once a week
2015-10-12 14:36:19	wigglesthewizard	Hmm, I figured you stopped playing sm64 due to boredom. Would you say it got stale?
2015-10-12 14:36:23	siglemic	many ppl do not understand that but you just have to remember how often i actually streamed back then
2015-10-12 14:36:33	truespcb	i was never around during those days
2015-10-12 14:36:53	truespcb	this is the only sig i know
2015-10-12 14:37:04	siglemic	Kreygasm
2015-10-12 14:37:10	luigi811	full of PogChamp moments
2015-10-12 14:37:13	truespcb	i still find it a little hard to believe but it makes perfect sense
2015-10-12 14:37:24	lakilester5626	I remember when we all saw your face at AGDQ for the first time. It was magical.
2015-10-12 14:37:32	truespcb	im not dumb
2015-10-12 14:37:48	magikilo	i remember the 48 hr stream attempts, those were the days
2015-10-12 14:37:56	slotter11	Sig, whats your goal for agi currently?
2015-10-12 14:38:03	truespcb	well no
2015-10-12 14:38:04	lakilester5626	And when you tried to do 12 hours a day for all of August.
2015-10-12 14:38:28	truespcb	yeah i remember the 12 hours a day thing in an old highlight
2015-10-12 14:38:33	truespcb	or something
2015-10-12 14:39:14	slotter11	17 more to go!
2015-10-12 14:39:33	sc2isbalanced	i think 72
