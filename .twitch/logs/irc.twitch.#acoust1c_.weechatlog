2015-07-13 04:02:07	themedevilgamer	I wish there was a full body suit that made you feel when you got shot or hit or something, not like painfully, but not comftoably either
2015-07-13 04:02:10	danhalen_	and instead of minecraft, now we're getting streams of games that are huge for a few weeks, then quickly die out
2015-07-13 04:02:14	slever903	i want a hololens for everything
2015-07-13 04:02:24	danhalen_	to make way for the next huge short-life game

2015-07-13 04:02:48	danhalen_	like Rocket League. It's one of the biggest games right now on twitch, but it'll be dead in a few weeks, i guarantee it
2015-07-13 04:02:51	llamacheese12	Id rather buy one game and play for 5-10 years then buy 50-100 games and play for 1-2 weeks

2015-07-13 06:55:35	walltje	while you are in a curved ramp you have to strafe at the same direction with a and d. youre losing all your speed if you dont
2015-07-13 06:55:55	danhalen_	It helps with the music festival i go to, because the campsite is right next to an airport... right under the flight path... and those flights go all night
2015-07-13 06:55:59	danhalen_	it becomes calming
2015-07-13 06:56:02	superbro7777	you can do it i believe in you

Their are some streams that I watch that have been plagued with the problem for weeks and they've all emailed twitch about it and still no response. Is their anything else we could do to get this problem taken care of? (Again I'm super sorry I just have no clue who else to turn to)
2015-07-19 22:49:13	llamacheese12	Thats unfortunate @Acoust1c_  I really enjoyed the good old days with you and the build guild, but i guess if youve found more enjoyable games, it is your happiness in gaming and streaming that is most important i guess :))

2015-07-21 20:42:56	danhalen_	i think the only reason league is as popular as it is is because it's free

2015-07-21 20:44:35	tolieman55	And it's free
2015-07-21 20:44:38	danhalen_	tf2 was hugely popular back in the day
2015-07-21 20:44:43	danhalen_	just like league is now
2015-07-21 20:45:00	tolieman55	Yea league will die out soon

2015-07-21 20:45:08	madtom123	its kind of hard to get into if you have no one to teach you or play with
2015-07-21 20:45:08	jokernetswarm	league also seems to be a popular screensaver for streamers who don't really plan to actually play a game ;)
2015-07-21 20:45:14	tolieman55	And will become the next tf2
2015-07-21 20:45:37	cake_buster	i think I need to try out League. I tried Dota 2, but i couldnt figure anything out
2015-07-21 20:45:39	danhalen_	like minecraft has kinda died out a whole lot recently
2015-07-21 20:45:47	danhalen_	we need a new "minecraft"
2015-07-21 20:45:53	coinstar1029	Acou, to be honest you should try heroes of the storm before you go back to league. i personally enjoy it more
2015-07-21 20:45:57	danhalen_	something huge that'll last years
2015-07-21 20:46:12	fukostarfish	Minecraft is still quite popular
2015-07-21 20:46:17	madtom123	there is a new minecraft game coming out
2015-07-21 20:46:25	luckyjames6434	what's Minecraft? Kappa
2015-07-21 20:46:35	tolieman55	Minecraft is slowly gonna die
2015-07-21 20:46:37	danhalen_	minecraft is popular, but it's only about half as popular as it was last year

2015-07-22 19:43:15	cswykert	If you go to steam, there are tabs at the top. Click on community>Market. Then type in the name of the gun you want. @Mjrlegends 
2015-07-22 19:43:17	cake_buster	yeah opening cases is more rewarding, you feel like you earned the skin. That said, gambling is hell of a drug KappaPride

2015-07-22 21:51:14	rrivaden03	I was lurking and missed the whole thing....
2015-07-22 21:51:19	rrivaden03	rip me
2015-07-22 21:51:33	wormskull	stickers on a gun with a skin already is such a bad look imo..
2015-07-22 21:52:05	danhalen_	Rrivaden03, you can find it in the VOD. Just skip forward a little bit until you get to where the big donations happen
2015-07-22 21:52:10	robat88	huntsman fade also
2015-07-22 21:52:31	rrivaden03	Gracias @DanHalen_ I shall find it Kappa

2015-07-22 21:53:44	wormskull	i wish you could have the option to just have a text thing about how many kills since the little counter thing ruins how a lot of guns look to me
2015-07-22 21:54:22	reaperzforever134	How do u get ur crosshairs looking like that?
2015-07-22 21:54:59	wormskull	look up crashz on the workshop and search for his crosshair map
2015-07-22 21:55:02	wormskull	and u can make ur own 
2015-07-22 21:55:11	wormskull	and i meant the stat track counter thing on the side of the gun
2015-07-22 21:56:15	wormskull	or you could mess around in the console by typing "cl_crosshair" and looking through the list that pops up of different options
2015-07-22 21:56:18	danhalen_	!crosshair
2015-07-22 21:56:18	acoubot	Crosshair was made using the community workshop map " Crashz' Crosshair Generator V2 " A fully customizable crosshair generator in game!

2015-07-22 22:02:03	wormskull	one of the most popular streamers on this site has i think never ever used a facecam. and plenty of popular casters just use their headset's microphone
2015-07-22 22:02:09	jacobistheboss1001	Going to buy a gaming of for I can finally record games, stream on twitch and play cs go

2015-07-22 22:10:15	eatityoshi	Yeh. I'd upgrade the graphics card and CPU.

2015-07-22 22:10:45	charizard_11	what is her rank?
2015-07-22 22:10:50	focuzed	You don't need to upgrade anything. If you MUST  upgrade something go for GPU but even then your 770 can run anything thrown at it for the next year or 2
2015-07-22 22:11:05	focuzed	the i74770k is still a top of the line processor
2015-07-22 22:11:07	nearlyanoob	You just need to overclock CPU and get a 900 series gpu
2015-07-22 22:11:19	cake_buster	If CSGO gets an engine update, to Source 2, a GPU will be even more important.
2015-07-22 22:11:33	whyworldwhyyyyyy	hello acou!
2015-07-22 22:11:41	pike15	gpu is only thing I'd look at upgrading.  anything else is going to be a lot of money spent on a marginal upgrade
2015-07-22 22:11:55	wormskull	man that tuxedo looks really cool all worn out like that
2015-07-22 22:11:59	anata_wa_kawaidesu	HELLo
2015-07-22 22:12:43	cr4ck3t	:DD
2015-07-22 22:12:44	eatityoshi	Yeah, I mean, you don't HAVE to upgrade anything, but if you're really wanting to upgrade something, I'd go for a stronger graphics card. Still a good card that you have, though.
2015-07-22 22:12:57	focuzed	overclocking is stupid and doesn't mean much like it used too
2015-07-22 22:13:24	wormskull	holy crap this pizza came with FOUR!!! of those little mini pizza box tables in it!
2015-07-22 22:13:48	themehtevas	Just get a quad titan X setup. No big deal.
2015-07-22 22:13:59	focuzed	Overclocking a 4770k is like getting a b00b job when you already have perfect b00bs. There is no rhyme or reason too.
2015-07-22 22:14:09	eatityoshi	Are you looking at the 980 or the 980ti?
2015-07-22 22:14:11	nearlyanoob	You can boost from 3.5 to 4.2 if you have good cooling easy (if you have a k series)
2015-07-22 22:14:37	focuzed	There is NO NEED TOO. It is already a monster, why would you push it farther? Just to say you did.
2015-07-22 22:15:05	wormskull	its 14 inch
2015-07-22 22:16:29	lionz27	@Acoust1c_ do u have ur set up as a link on pcpartpicker or no

2015-07-22 22:17:36	focuzed	@Danhalen_ Even better but for streaming/gaming purposes a 4770k is WAY more enough
2015-07-22 22:17:37	wormskull	m4s a nice gun to learn the discipline for that since its just a backwards L basically. just move it straight left after half the clip
2015-07-22 22:17:48	lionz27	can some one make an update of her specs and poost it in chat so we can look at it
2015-07-22 22:18:31	focuzed	@Acoust1c_ That is bitrate related
2015-07-22 22:18:36	gymthepotato	I wouldnt know I have the crappiest computer ever :C
2015-07-22 22:18:42	gymthepotato	I have 4 upload :D
2015-07-22 22:18:45	wormskull	its encoding settings and only a computer thing if youre limiting your settings by your hardware
2015-07-22 22:18:53	cake_buster	You would need better internet :p
2015-07-22 22:18:59	pike15	twitch needs to up their bitrate cap from 3500
2015-07-22 22:19:02	wormskull	so its kinda both
2015-07-22 22:19:21	cake_buster	Messing with the x264 preset would help, but make your game lag a lot
2015-07-22 22:19:37	lionz27	can some one make an update of her specs and poost it in chat so we can look at it

2015-07-22 22:20:24	pike15	yes they need to raise past 3500 bitrate and that would smooth a lot of the m
2015-07-22 22:20:24	wormskull	if youre on CT they have a m4 instead

2015-07-22 22:20:55	nearlyanoob	@gymthepotato 230 what?
2015-07-22 22:20:59	focuzed	@Acoust1c_ you could set your profile a tad slower and up your bitrate a tad as well, with a 4770k your encoding profile could be slower. But when upping your bitrate it hurts the viewers with *** connections but you have encoding so that's not as big of an issue as nonpartnered.
2015-07-22 22:21:13	gymthepotato	Can I post a link?

You're better off getting two 60Hz monitors for about the same price. Do you need Wi-Fi? Might want a Corsair Power Supply. You need an SSD. I prefer Corsair RAM.

2015-07-23 00:27:04	fmentz	Superswag3211,  I think you are confusing "free for one year" with "1 year free trial."
2015-07-23 00:27:07	vswiftii	Basically make a giant circle but make sure you go across the middle
2015-07-23 00:27:10	coolkid654321	like you did before you landed on the other side and then go straight up right after to get the fastest speed
2015-07-23 00:27:12	cynicalc	That's what he said Kappa

2015-07-23 00:33:37	vorisi	Ugh. Lions if you get a cheaper windows 7, you'll still get the free upgrade to 10. Do you really need an optical drive? You're better off getting two 60Hz monitors for about the same price. Do you need Wi-Fi? Might want a Corsair Power Supply. You need an SSD. I prefer Corsair RAM.

2015-07-25 00:45:32	coinstar1029	thunder33333,  depends on what sounds more enticing, newer country tends to be more upbeat as older things are a bit more southern twang to them

You're a rude mod, and I don't see how you're still at this position with your insults. Now go ahead and time me out, or even perma ban. I had to get that out. It's really you making yourself look bad when insulting someone else. See you guys in like a year, now.

2015-07-27 05:26:12	cake_buster	Apparently, you are to listen first for sounds before turning on the flashlight.
2015-07-27 05:26:28	rrivaden03	I don't do well with jumpscares. But after a few times it gets a lot better and you now what you're actually doing
2015-07-27 05:26:29	escapade3	Good luck!
2015-07-27 05:26:31	mrwafflemg	Hi :)
2015-07-27 05:26:47	rrivaden03	Biggest thing on the first few nights..LISTEN for sounds on the doors
2015-07-27 05:27:02	rrivaden03	If you hear breathing near you you have to close the door, keep counts, etc etc
2015-07-27 05:27:04	updates_	the closet is not a threat in night one

2015-07-27 05:28:21	rrivaden03	It's just based in its jumpscares D:

2015-07-27 05:28:32	eatityoshi	The game itself isn't really that scary.
2015-07-27 05:28:32	flyinghotsauce	the breathing is very complicated because the volume of the breathing changes depending on the animatronics
2015-07-27 05:28:32	vic_6_3d	omg this one much more scarier in a room

2015-07-30 02:08:36	umitszachfromstatefarm	I sexually Identify as an Attack Helicopter. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of soaring over the oilfields dropping hot sticky loads on disgusting foreigners. People say to me that a person being a helicopter is Impossible and I'm *** retarded but I don't care, I'm beautiful. I'm having a plastic surgeon install rotary blades, 30 mm cannons and AMG-114 Hellfire missiles on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me "Apache" and respect my right to kill from above and kill needlessly.
