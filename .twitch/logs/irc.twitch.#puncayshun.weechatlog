2015-06-28 03:56:30	mal1t1a	I'm a dedicated fanstraight Puncayshun, I watched your dark souls stream very often
2015-06-28 03:56:35	psychomantisxx	People throw the word " sellout " around way too much. You DO realize once you get partnered if you want to turn this into something you do as a career you HAVE to play what your viewerbase is interested in
2015-06-28 03:56:36	pyraxy	Dood I got a sick knife
2015-06-28 03:56:42	bitcove	i kinda agree i love mario but after 2-3 runs im done and ready for something else

2015-06-28 03:57:20	xhoshikox	Streaming even when not partnered is being a sellout because you could be playing games on your own and now care about sharing your gamplay with others KappaPride
2015-06-28 03:57:22	thesingular1ty	I miss the days when @puncayshun's title was just "whirl recky runs" BibleThump
2015-06-28 03:57:23	gothiclogic	Just play the games you were playing beforehand, the thing they got partnered for
2015-06-28 03:57:24	automat1cjack	Punc, you aint a sellout
2015-06-28 03:57:24	gothiclogic	Idiot
2015-06-28 03:57:27	psychomantisxx	He loses tons of viewers if he plays ANYTHING besides mario, same logic
2015-06-28 03:57:45	mal1t1a	Puncayshun if you turn on selloutcam and do a dance ill sub
2015-06-28 03:57:47	link1255	people who call people sellouts are sooks
2015-06-28 03:57:48	ab27826	yeah but if he plays not mario, he doesn't expect to get mario viewers
2015-06-28 03:57:59	psychomantisxx	Not the point
2015-06-28 03:58:00	poopy_fingers	You're not a sellout hut you are washed up like siglemic.

2015-06-28 04:00:01	psychomantisxx	Well you should enjoy anything you do for a career, but it's easier said than done. You WILL get bored eventually and when you try to switch games you'll be hung by quite a few of the people that followed you just because they follow the game not the person

2015-06-28 04:33:56	nickt97	Only person that consistently takes out hbox is mango so if they never play eachother I think hbox has a good chance of winning

2015-06-28 04:38:22	15dylan91	why does everyone on twitch have a waifu these days

2015-06-28 04:38:55	mal1t1a	I see people with sub buttons using follower alerts more often than not.
2015-06-28 04:39:01	aussiegrit	You forgot to split lol
2015-06-28 04:39:16	smurfquake	Follow alerts for a giant stream are fucking dumb, just saying.
2015-06-28 04:39:20	valkskorn	Dude punc you also have those dudes watching their chat on who who say hi to you when you join their like 60 person stream
2015-06-28 04:39:22	teletubbyking	Puncay that's because you have 48,000 subs
2015-06-28 04:39:33	jacks0ny	if you have like ... 50 follower and like barely watcher .. and then you get a follower in like 2 -3 days...
2015-06-28 04:39:37	caracarnvi	some people used to say hi to everyone that joined the chat by reading the joins on IRC
2015-06-28 04:39:43	caracarnvi	that was always weird
2015-06-28 04:39:52	tohkerthejoker	@puncayshun split your upstairs ya nerd
2015-06-28 04:39:52	lostscientist	well i mean, I have like, 130 followers atm. and get maybe 1-3 a day, would it be bad in my scenario?
2015-06-28 04:39:57	mxyplex	that is weird CaracarnVi ;s

2015-06-28 04:40:07	smurfquake	Lost: Not as bad as a big streamer.
2015-06-28 04:40:26	mal1t1a	I think it might be interesting to throw up s follower alert (no sound) and just have the text not contain their username. I.e. "+1 follower"
2015-06-28 04:40:30	psychomantisxx	Honestly do whatever you want, if you're big on personal communication with your followers it doesn't hurt
2015-06-28 04:40:31	mxyplex	when it's that small LostScientist, it's ok. but not everyone wants to interact, and by calling people out it kinda "forces" them to do it.
2015-06-28 04:40:31	alundari	Puncay do you play Osu!?
2015-06-28 04:40:48	chickenlivernuts	is this agar.io?
2015-06-28 04:40:53	ab27826	gah twitter is so quiet at ass o'clock
2015-06-28 04:40:55	bloopydooper	1:06:12 for upstairs
2015-06-28 04:40:56	good_snacks	Sub hype in general is annoying. I hate hearing some streamer spout the same bullshit after every sub.
2015-06-28 04:40:58	adouliofficial	whos the best on ceo?
2015-06-28 04:41:08	the_bear89	I think thanking followers depends also on what game you are playing and also if you have a new stream it can be nice
2015-06-28 04:41:13	lostscientist	@Mxyplex what if i said thank you, but not by name?
2015-06-28 04:41:19	smurfquake	I think sub alerts aren't that amazing. Donation alerts are like the only thing needed ever imo.
2015-06-28 04:41:27	tohkerthejoker	who gets 10k average?
2015-06-28 04:41:30	caracarnvi	donation alerts are annoying too
2015-06-28 04:41:33	jacks0ny	and for small streamer... ?
2015-06-28 04:41:33	maarten_blom	FailFish
2015-06-28 04:41:34	ab27826	he was saying sodapoppin
2015-06-28 04:41:41	xxuberneroxx	I tink following alert is OK when you are not extreamly popular
2015-06-28 04:41:49	caracarnvi	because 90% of the donations are troll donations in order for their name to pop up
2015-06-28 04:41:50	jacks0ny	when does popular starts
2015-06-28 04:41:56	mal1t1a	Epic
2015-06-28 04:42:07	teletubbyking	Lost I think it's perfectly fine to have an alert for your sizd
2015-06-28 04:42:16	smurfquake	Question: Do hosts show up somewhere if you don't have those alerts on?
2015-06-28 04:42:22	lostscientist	okay, thanks tele
2015-06-28 04:42:26	ab27826	dashboard smurf
2015-06-28 04:42:28	caracarnvi	it shows in the chat
2015-06-28 04:42:29	mxyplex	sure LostScientist , it's w/e. it's all subjective really, people are different. just do what you want really, if people don't like it then ok. you can't please everyone
2015-06-28 04:42:32	saltypicklessss	You suck
2015-06-28 04:42:35	alundari	It's hard for me to watch a streamer that's worse than me at a game. You don't have to be a pro but it seems like a waste of time
2015-06-28 04:42:36	saltypicklessss	Your bad
2015-06-28 04:42:42	saltypicklessss	Die

2015-06-28 04:43:38	alundari	I wish i was as good as Binny
2015-06-28 04:43:44	mal1t1a	Puncayshun if you weren't so good at this bad game is u sub right now
2015-06-28 04:43:47	alundari	But the dude probably logs in 50+ hours a week
2015-06-28 04:43:47	unholydevils	He is the halo streamer with the Halo kill alert for Halo viewers that could never get annoying
2015-06-28 04:43:50	teletubbyking	Nice troll
2015-06-28 04:43:52	mxyplex	FailFish
2015-06-28 04:44:02	mxyplex	that's the worst trolling i've ever seen
2015-06-28 04:44:03	jacks0ny	could it be .. that the language you playing the game in .. is a reason for followers?
2015-06-28 04:44:13	saltypicklessss	I love how PJSalt everyone is getting
2015-06-28 04:44:19	jerrif	Kappa
2015-06-28 04:44:19	psychomantisxx	It's strange how many people are totally ok with streams that have someone who seems to be totally inept at even the most basic of mechanics with games though.
2015-06-28 04:44:21	chickenlivernuts	i still dont get why biny is just one giant meme, he seems pretty chill
2015-06-28 04:44:22	bden19	saltypicklessss i fucked ur dad
2015-06-28 04:44:23	unholydevils	If the alert is a sound from the game you enjoy then it wont get annoying like with monopoli
2015-06-28 04:44:25	alundari	Even then though
2015-06-28 04:44:31	teletubbyking	If you actually had friends I'd be upset lmao
2015-06-28 04:44:32	saltypicklessss	What's the best troll you have seen then pussy?
2015-06-28 04:44:37	honkyprog	GUYS WATCH OUT THE PJSalt MAKER IS HERE OH NO
2015-06-28 04:44:38	psychomantisxx	I'd say it's their personality, but ......The people in mind don't really have one
2015-06-28 04:44:43	jacks0ny	like.. if you play in german or russian people dont follow that often ... but if you stream in english people do follow ?
2015-06-28 04:44:44	saltypicklessss	There is no such thing as a bad troll
2015-06-28 04:44:46	yukl0528	I'm Japanese.
2015-06-28 04:44:52	bden19	saltypicklessss that reminds me, can you have him stop calling me please, its gettin annoying
2015-06-28 04:44:53	alundari	I'd never play a game for 50+ hours a week unless i wanted to be really good
2015-06-28 04:45:09	caracarnvi	@Jacks0ny it depends on the game, I generally get less viewers on average when I play FF in Japanese
2015-06-28 04:45:12	mal1t1a	Real talk puncaysbun, why don't you have a sub sound? It could be something like Mario's "Yahoo" sound
2015-06-28 04:45:12	saltypicklessss	I'm obviously doing good trolling because you guys are getting Burt hurt
2015-06-28 04:45:15	gakkusannu	EleGiggle =/= PJSalt

2015-06-28 04:45:19	caracarnvi	but a game like this the language doesn't really matter
2015-06-28 04:45:23	teletubbyking	You think that because you're a bad troll and don't wanna feel bad about yourself
2015-06-28 04:45:26	psychomantisxx	Well *
2015-06-28 04:45:29	psychomantisxx	not good
2015-06-28 04:45:30	jacks0ny	i get 0 viewers if i play ff 14 on german ... @CaracarnVi

2015-06-28 05:03:47	alundari	The WR is good but not unbeatable

2015-06-28 05:04:37	richspeightjr	@Mal1t1a that's a thing that actually happened??
2015-06-28 05:04:42	smurfquake	I'm trying to think of the most unbeatable WR right now actually. 
2015-06-28 05:04:47	bealsky	hahah I think I remember that Healpear
2015-06-28 05:04:51	alundari	18:10 Kappa
2015-06-28 05:04:55	kylez3	Be quiet dude?
2015-06-28 05:04:55	mal1t1a	I WOULD RESLLY SPPRECIATE IT IF YOU WOULD BE WUIET.
2015-06-28 05:05:00	doubleac15gaming	not even close lol
2015-06-28 05:05:00	bealsky	Every WR has a limit
2015-06-28 05:05:01	smurfquake	Probably one of the most optimized runs is Super Mario Bros though.
2015-06-28 05:05:11	redsox830	Goldeneye ILs unbeatable :P
2015-06-28 05:05:20	richspeightjr	i watched the "be quiet" vid today omg
2015-06-28 05:05:23	pauliegohome	oh yeah SMB is people trying to improve by milliseconds
2015-06-28 05:05:31	naughtystrawberry	puncay I hope you play better than this at SGDQ
2015-06-28 05:05:31	jerrif	BEALSKY, the limit is the TAS, isn't it?
2015-06-28 05:05:32	pauliegohome	rough speedgame
2015-06-28 05:05:32	healpear	Kylez3 look up caveman and toki you wont be disappointed
2015-06-28 05:05:37	ethansgaming123	Richspeightjr the SGDQ 2014 one?

2015-06-28 05:05:56	smurfquake	Although all other SMB categories besides Any% warps is not as optimized.
2015-06-28 05:05:57	mal1t1a	Atm
2015-06-28 05:05:58	bealsky	what's TAS
2015-06-28 05:06:02	pauliegohome	there is no goldeneye TAS that you can compare with the console runs
2015-06-28 05:06:04	richspeightjr	@Ethansgaming123 the be quiet vid? i think that was 2014 yeah 
2015-06-28 05:06:10	teletubbyking	Unless it's TAS it's not unbeatable
2015-06-28 05:06:11	jerrif	BEALSKY, tool assisted speedrun
2015-06-28 05:06:13	zethzooken	has he done any zero star attempts?

2015-06-28 05:06:17	gbot322	I heard DomnicDD was taking his spot at SGDQ
2015-06-28 05:06:23	smurfquake	Rwhitegoose got a new untied WR recently actually. I forget the name of the level, the one before Train.
2015-06-28 05:06:25	gothiclogic	Even TAS can be beaten by another TAS lol
2015-06-28 05:06:31	redsox830	I didn't think TAS's would count in this conversation
2015-06-28 05:06:31	ethansgaming123	@Richspeightjr i would really prefer if you'd be quiet noizOgre

2015-06-28 05:06:40	jerrif	it should technically be the fastest possible time to beat the game
2015-06-28 05:06:46	pauliegohome	yeah you can't really compare them
2015-06-28 05:06:53	mal1t1a	Tas doesn't beat another tas, it just sets a pb Kappa
2015-06-28 05:06:54	richspeightjr	lol @Ethansgaming123 
2015-06-28 05:06:59	pauliegohome	there's tons of lag reduction strats in goldeneye runs
2015-06-28 05:07:01	redsox830	TAS
2015-06-28 05:07:01	ripsotype	tas is theoretically the time a human could get if playing perfectly
2015-06-28 05:07:04	richspeightjr	@Healpear solid plan really
2015-06-28 05:07:06	whiteren	But you can use TAS inputs on N64
2015-06-28 05:07:07	gothiclogic	No it isn't
2015-06-28 05:07:08	alundari	First person to pull off carpetless is the new SM64 god
2015-06-28 05:07:10	redsox830	TAS's can do things that humans can't possibly do
2015-06-28 05:07:14	alundari	Even if the dude is garbage at the game
2015-06-28 05:07:20	alundari	^
2015-06-28 05:07:20	mastoise	Ripsotype, wrong
2015-06-28 05:07:22	gothiclogic	If you watched most TASes you'd know a lot of them aren't humanly possible

2015-06-28 05:07:44	mastoise	a human cannot physically do  the inputs fast enough
2015-06-28 05:07:48	tohkerthejoker	@Gothiclogic you fail to understand the word "possible" --
2015-06-28 05:07:48	mal1t1a	This isn't a tas run live??????
2015-06-28 05:07:53	tohkerthejoker	all TAS runs are humanly "possible"
2015-06-28 05:08:02	gothiclogic	I'm sorry what?
2015-06-28 05:08:02	pauliegohome	that's not entirely true
2015-06-28 05:08:09	jerrif	TohkerTheJoker, that's not true
2015-06-28 05:08:11	doubleac15gaming	it's not possible
2015-06-28 05:08:22	pauliegohome	there are TAS tricks that require inputs faster than human hands could possibly do
2015-06-28 05:08:25	bealsky	its the threshold 
2015-06-28 05:08:26	gothiclogic	Tell me when you can do hundreds of HSWKs in a row

2015-06-29 23:31:12	ihgkowz	He cannot just "get another controller of the same brand/variety". N64 controllers were made in finite supply and no more have been made in a decade. Not only that, but  Kazakhstan, Trinidad, and best Korea changed their national currency to the "N64 ¢ontroller" for a good three years. America, sworn enemies of best Korea for being the bestest tanked the N64 controller market by buying them all up and mailing them to Biinny's house. Now Biinny holds millions of unopened, pristine controllers hostage and the few, sparse amounts left over are high in price and short in stock.

2015-06-29 23:58:45	ihgkowz	I am worried guys. I am worried that when I lay my hands down to rest for the night I will be parting from something once great and leaving it to rot unattended and no longer cared for. I fear that when I stop my fingers for the night I will be relinquishing the evils of the world to our sanctuary to plague the masses with silence and boredom. To prevent that I insist we collectively try to write a cookbook and call it "Puncays MayMay Bakery Book of Memes" and we will put it on coffee tables across Trinidad. We will sell one copy because there is only one coffee table in Trinidad.

2015-06-30 00:21:33	ihgkowz	I would love to have the Ice Cream pokemon so I can eat it. Pokemon never die so it'd revive if I sent it to the hospital or fed it poop cubes or w/e the fuck they eat then I would eat it again. I would eat it everyday to send the message that it is my bitch and will be nothing but a delicious dessert for the rest of its days on Earth. My kids would inherit Mr. Snowconemon and eat it. Their kids would eat it. If my family chain would end I would donate it to Africa to feed the poor and malnourished.

2015-06-30 00:21:52	solarcook	digimon?  easy.  Apocalymon.  Because then I can feed him pizza and let him live his dream.

2015-06-30 00:24:18	ihgkowz	Mario is actually a human infused sour candy man from Mars. Whenever he bops a Goomba they make a ">.<" face before dying and poofing out of existence whilst pooping out a gold coin. They make the same face a toddler makes upon eating something sour. Mario is actually a candy treat warrior designed to please the Toadstool gods with endless, painfully delicious sour delight.

2015-06-30 00:30:44	ihgkowz	I'd assume you have the class because you fucked up somewhere along the line so I hope whatever happened doesn't happen again. If its because some bullshit reason like a job needs you to take it then just suck it up and bring a book

Toad's have little circular gyro balls for hands and Mario's fingers are so big and blocky he couldn't hold a pencil fused with two cucumbers and a stick of chalk. Who is this mysterious, literate sign maker who is secretly giving tips to Mario to thwart and overthrow the Bowser empire?

2015-06-30 21:38:26	gunraykilla	It depends on if you get them Perscrip or not
2015-06-30 21:38:29	finalslayerofbodom	Sub 1:40:00 is going to take a ton of new tricks, heh.

2015-07-01 00:39:49	toasthashost	I'm actually confused. So there's no difference to doing the stars in a different order? 
2015-07-01 00:40:06	wiener_explosion69	Hay puncayshun Noice rings of Saturn shirt!
2015-07-01 00:40:10	dartagnonw	I told you, it makes the bosses RNG easier to predecit.
2015-07-01 00:40:14	dartagnonw	*predickt
2015-07-01 00:40:17	egahbh	ToastHasHost, i think a lot of it is preference outside of maybe what gets grouped together with the 100c stars
2015-07-01 00:40:26	egahbh	but again some stars are triggered by other stars
2015-07-01 00:40:32	egahbh	and im not too sure about anything outside of that
2015-07-01 00:40:54	ihgkowz	It isn't a joke. When you enter a star it has to calculate the creature vectors on the old school 64 bit nintendo engine (N64). Old applications suffer from poor initiation of electrons from on and off switches. You want to have things already on stay on and vice versa. You NEED to have as many things turn off and on at once as possible to minimize times you need to do it. Thus doing the stars in the right order is pivotal to a speedy run. The first routing shaved 69 seconds back in 2012 and further routing has cut it down to 4 minutes and 20 seconds.

2015-07-01 00:42:31	hahasniper1	did cheese quit already?
2015-07-01 00:42:34	elg_chief	Toast it matters because the star order that the runners are using is faster than any other route, they have back up routes in case they fail to get a certain star/strategy backfires

2015-07-01 00:45:11	profsweetness	haha holy shit. i just looked up what gunars are. thats pretty  cool i guess
2015-07-01 00:45:26	ihgkowz	Puncayshun uses prescription glasses with sun reduction tint that mimic sunglasses outside. They are actually cheaper than gunner. However, to get them you must have an elite militia license or military training. They enhance a person's vision several fold and are outlawed in the United States to be used by ordinary citizens because of their ability to give inhuman far sight and precision which would help a person use a sniper rifle.
2015-07-01 00:45:27	egahbh	onefor_JJ, i mean there's no midair jump
2015-07-01 00:45:32	egahbh	so his recovery would be ass-er

2015-07-01 23:24:37	nl7_	@TwitchStopPermaBanningMe, if you're on wifi, you're sharing an ip

2015-07-01 23:25:17	gull_ssbm	Now just estimate how many of those are completed runs to get some kind of approximation I guess
2015-07-01 23:25:18	mikew94	Also the number of people who have internet is significantly smaller than the number of people on the Earth
2015-07-01 23:25:20	twitchstoppermabanningme	Yeah but still, there's enough IP's.
2015-07-01 23:25:26	truckjitsu	pretty sure mobile data is unique

2015-07-01 23:27:29	mikew94	@stringchee5e because you need the wing cap to get all the stars in BB so you return anyway

2015-07-01 23:55:35	dr_locker	M2K might be too late with evo coming up but you should ask Trihex what he wears on his hands. He wears these hand casts on his hands when he sleeps and said they help

2015-07-01 23:57:01	gull_ssbm	I think the way Trihex plays looks wayyy more wrist intensive so that's why he wears those
2015-07-01 23:57:03	torchiic	m2k are you sure there isnt excersices for that? i mean i know for sure there is something to do
2015-07-01 23:57:14	johnsmash	just do it jason, don't let your dreams be dreams

2015-07-01 23:58:53	erodneequinox	what happened to the Hori remotes?
2015-07-01 23:59:00	torchiic	try changing slowly, that is better than not being able to play... changing from claw to normal disminishes preasure on your hands
2015-07-01 23:59:08	staiain	trihex hardens his hand stamina with stepmania TriHard
2015-07-01 23:59:21	egahbh	stepmania looks fucking hard

2015-07-02 00:00:08	thesingular1ty	I'm surprised that wasn't a reset
2015-07-02 00:00:15	shed_ninja	@Staiain do you have hand pains when you play stepmania? would like to hear some top ranker insight :)
2015-07-02 00:00:16	mew2king	no melee171

2015-07-02 00:01:16	qwoodmansee	@mew2king his little talk about "increasing speed" and stuff is probably garbage, but I think that's just how he is trying to convince people to do them. Saying "you won't hurt your hand" won't convince a lot of young gamers, but saying "you'll get better speed" is a good way to convince people to do it (even though it may be bs haha.) the stretches and stuff definitely won't hurt

2015-07-02 00:09:16	fireblaze3127	plup is my hero
2015-07-02 00:09:18	mew2king	Smash 4 nerfed Diddy so much and then kept changing the game and i also get BORED OF IT UGH
2015-07-02 00:09:19	thesingular1ty	didn't think he'd get 2 12.7s
2015-07-02 00:09:21	nanacomehome	plup <3 <3 <3
2015-07-02 00:09:22	mew2king	its more fun with customs tbh =/

2015-07-02 00:09:36	dndragons	What's the current WR?
2015-07-02 00:09:38	chyaddo	yeah, changing the game really screws over people trying to get good
2015-07-02 00:09:41	cankerworm	Plup is sooo fun to watch.
2015-07-02 00:09:41	fireblaze3127	m2k do you still wanna play brawl?
2015-07-02 00:09:42	jim_the_destroyer	i hate how they are nerfing the game

2015-07-02 00:09:49	uraniulvl	@mew2king are u done with melee
2015-07-02 00:09:51	ferrero64	I played smash 4 for 2 months and couldnt like the game
2015-07-02 00:09:56	thesingular1ty	Puncay I've seen Akira go through the flames without taking damage, is that a thing?
2015-07-02 00:09:56	dokuroman	Every time I'm in one of his streams, he fucks up on this level.
2015-07-02 00:09:58	cankerworm	brawl has finally died? Kappa
2015-07-02 00:09:58	mew2king	They arent even buffing they are just nerfing shit so you cant kill until forever
2015-07-02 00:10:02	mew2king	thats so annoying
2015-07-02 00:10:03	ferrero64	i played everyday and am good at it
2015-07-02 00:10:04	mew2king	i wanna kill fast -.-
2015-07-02 00:10:04	torchiic	m2k you should put your money into heallth care, like what can you do ig you cant move your hands later on
2015-07-02 00:10:08	thesweetbabyhelix	will you ever speedrun m2k? you seem to like fast gaming
2015-07-02 00:10:09	nanacomehome	StL has the most colossal plup boner lol
2015-07-02 00:10:13	mew2king	Torchilic what do you mean ?
2015-07-02 00:10:26	dndragons	That was my problem with Smash 4 from day 1.
2015-07-02 00:10:28	saladpoke	Balance patches for sm4sh will stop eventually, probably sooner rather than later
2015-07-02 00:10:28	wcdorrell	Melee master race!
2015-07-02 00:10:30	jewishmenace	sf is actually designed to be interesting guise KappPride
2015-07-02 00:10:30	jim_the_destroyer	the game is pointless if you get good kill combos
2015-07-02 00:10:35	bournetopwn	Sub 1k nooo
2015-07-02 00:10:36	jim_the_destroyer	takes to long
2015-07-02 00:10:38	bournetopwn	Let's gooooo
2015-07-02 00:10:44	minifurnace	Its gonna be funny when there is no melee and everyone has to conform to 4
2015-07-02 00:10:48	torchiic	get proper threatment or your hands will not "work" in simple terms
2015-07-02 00:10:52	mew2king	yea its annoying
2015-07-02 00:10:53	jewishmenace	>taking casual game seriously
2015-07-02 00:10:54	dndragons	You couldn't kill anyone, it went from 4 stocks in 8 minutes to 2 stocks in 6
2015-07-02 00:10:55	mew2king	I just love Doubles in every smash game
2015-07-02 00:11:00	chyaddo	@Puncayshun do you ever have trouble with your hands hurting?
2015-07-02 00:11:01	kurosaki1o9	m2k are you good with megaman
2015-07-02 00:11:02	stratta23	like in LoL?
2015-07-02 00:11:03	thesweetbabyhelix	the more people complain the more patches they'll put
2015-07-02 00:11:04	dndragons	an entire extra minute per stock for how long it takes
2015-07-02 00:11:04	bujeebus	4 will die before melee lol
2015-07-02 00:11:16	minifurnace	probably not
2015-07-02 00:11:19	theukuleleguy	I actually prefer doubles
2015-07-02 00:11:19	jewishmenace	league is the ultimate casual game
2015-07-02 00:11:22	ferrero64	idk but i feel you would be a TAS monster in speedrunning
2015-07-02 00:11:24	minifurnace	nintendo pushes 4 so hard
2015-07-02 00:11:28	uraniulvl	Smash 4 had great showing at ceo
2015-07-02 00:11:30	minifurnace	itll probably outlive melee
2015-07-02 00:11:38	zen_machine	Minifurnace you're a documentary kid
2015-07-02 00:11:41	jim_the_destroyer	i wish people took teams more seriously they are reallu entertaining
2015-07-02 00:11:41	cankerworm	I still don't get it, why people don't play only PAL version of SSBM, it's sooo much better in everyway.
2015-07-02 00:11:42	ricvr	oh nice Puncay is streaming

2015-07-02 00:11:56	weatherworn	I could see melee and smash 4 becoming like street fighter 2 and street fighter 4
2015-07-02 00:11:56	thesingular1ty	Puncay I'll be your left hand Kreygasm
2015-07-02 00:11:57	ferrero64	smash 4 wont outlive melee

2015-07-02 00:12:00	egahbh	Cankerworm, harder to find maybe?
2015-07-02 00:12:03	ferrero64	thats impossible
2015-07-02 00:12:06	fireblaze3127	smash 5 will be 1 stock right? SSB = 5 stock, SSBM = 4 stock, SSBB = 3 stock, SSB4 = 2 stock, so Smash 5 will have to be 1 stock to follow the pattern
2015-07-02 00:12:08	egahbh	Cankerworm, or USA pretty much dominated the smash scene
2015-07-02 00:12:08	muffinblight	no ken combo in pal
2015-07-02 00:12:11	egahbh	*dominates
2015-07-02 00:12:13	hahasniper1	note: 7 stocks can disappear in melee faster than 1 stock in smash 4

2015-07-02 00:12:24	saladpoke	Smash 4 will last til the inevitable smash 5 and will probably be replaced by it
2015-07-02 00:12:29	minifurnace	I think melee is a better game, and better to watch
2015-07-02 00:12:29	incross	lol at smash 4 outlasting melee
2015-07-02 00:12:32	dokuroman	Why do you play the Japanese version?
2015-07-02 00:12:34	billowny	just do the reverse up b instead of dair
2015-07-02 00:12:35	wunobi	Fireblaze3127 smash 5 is really just street fighter Keepo
2015-07-02 00:12:41	chyaddo	dealing with the airlines flying around must be a pain

2015-07-02 00:12:53	dndragons	Melee is still my favorite, i hate sounding like a melee fanboy but it gives you the most control and the most reward for playing well.

2015-07-02 00:13:49	qwoodmansee	Is it possible to work 100 coin into that star?
2015-07-02 00:13:50	mrbisonopolis	Melee is actually a great FG. Ive been in the FGC for a while and played all sorts of fighters. I definitely feel like Melee is a great game that rewards smart play, fundamentals, execution, and mindgames
2015-07-02 00:13:50	asic777	If Melee HD happens, they'll be sure to take out wavedashing and such
2015-07-02 00:13:50	cankerworm	I FUCKING HOPE, ssbm HD won't ever happend, that would be soo sad times.
2015-07-02 00:13:51	bujeebus	it just sucks that nintendo is shitting on PM
2015-07-02 00:13:56	dndragons	Melee imo has hard core facts backing it up to be better
2015-07-02 00:14:01	ferrero64	to be honest, smash 4 is the reason why melee wont die for the next 6 or 8 years
2015-07-02 00:14:02	chyaddo	just from someone who watches smash but doesn't play, melee is a lot more fun to wa tch
2015-07-02 00:14:14	cankerworm	Hey guys, did you see Metroid Prime Federation? Kappa
2015-07-02 00:14:18	wcdorrell	ssb4 is a well made game i just have the muscle memory for melee so i try to move to quickly.  also ssb4 is all about groud game where melee seems more about air game to me.\
2015-07-02 00:14:19	ferrero64	damn
2015-07-02 00:14:24	dndragons	Melee doubles are the best imo

2015-07-02 00:15:00	wcdorrell	@Mew2king whats your favorite doubles team to run?
2015-07-02 00:15:06	ferrero64	lmao
2015-07-02 00:15:06	saladpoke	Tbh I kind of wish smash 4 didn't allow the gamecube controller. Playing it with the gamecube controller makes it seem like it's trying to be melee when it's really it's own game. If you were forced to use a different controller, it would give the game a better identity imo. That's how I felt when 3DS version came out
2015-07-02 00:15:07	hahasniper1	oh mew2king is here
2015-07-02 00:15:08	dreamcastfansr	yesss

2015-07-02 00:17:02	torchiic	the most confortable controllers are from play station
2015-07-02 00:17:02	gravelcrusher	nintendo makes different controllers all the time but they manage to make a 3d mario game that fits the style for each controller
2015-07-02 00:17:08	ferrero64	nintengo might make bad controllers but they literally came up with everything
2015-07-02 00:17:09	saladpoke	I realize it's just a controller preference, that's just my opinion :) I mean right off the bat, it makes no sense to have analog triggers for smash 4 since you can't analog shield
2015-07-02 00:17:11	hahasniper1	did m2k play at ceo?
2015-07-02 00:17:11	vertov64	Dota 2 and LOl also share the same viewers

2015-07-02 00:19:52	saladpoke	Their thought process was that they weren't sure how many devs would want to make fully 3d games that need an analog stick and how many would wanna stick with 2d games. So N64 controller lets you grab the left and right parts of it for 2d platforming games, but you can also grab the middle and right parts of it for the analog stick and buttons. That was the design process I think, I forget where I heard/read it

2015-07-02 03:03:09	maplerzega	sdgq happens once a year (twice if you count agdq), and tourneys happen all the time. imo i think sgdq would be funner.
2015-07-02 03:03:10	soninova	no no, m2k I mean which would you play first. Paper Mario or Galaxy?
2015-07-02 03:03:11	iztikeit	Puncay has made comebacks on Cheese before, but Puncay usually messes up less and less as a run goes...

2015-07-02 03:20:03	dmxstopdrop123	Hello
2015-07-02 03:20:04	mew2king	natural talent is a bunch of BS, unless you define talent by potential, then we're all super talented if we're at the top
2015-07-02 03:20:04	iztikeit	So many people have gotten good just by being friends with Mango
2015-07-02 03:20:17	giraffeandmore	lame as in difficult to counter, you cant make him play
2015-07-02 03:20:17	iztikeit	Mangosmosis
2015-07-02 03:20:19	truckjitsu	IMO it's a lot more lame because PPMD GOES TO NO TOURNAMENTS
2015-07-02 03:20:20	pseudonymousmoniker	Just remember that leffens a fuck boy. That is all Kappa
2015-07-02 03:20:26	truckjitsu	if he went to tourneys it wouldn't be as lame
2015-07-02 03:20:29	jaggi00	yeah chillindude was complaning you didn't have "natural talent"
2015-07-02 03:20:31	truckjitsu	but he goes to fucking nothing
2015-07-02 03:20:32	thesingular1ty	Guys... I think Puncay can actually win

2015-07-02 03:20:38	krabpot	m2k, whats your honest opinion of leffen as a person?
2015-07-02 03:20:40	maplerzega	all natural talent does is it makes you overconfident
2015-07-02 03:20:43	mew2king	I think i have a lot of talent.   I beat all the best NES/SNES Games when i was like 4-6 years old
2015-07-02 03:20:46	riftwalkr	@pseudonymousmoniker no one is disagreeing with you there
2015-07-02 03:20:46	mew2king	I just had no one to play
2015-07-02 03:20:49	krabpot	chillindude is a washed up fuccboi

2015-07-02 03:20:54	johnsmash	what if mango is sandbagging all these tourneys before evo so people like PP can't study him
2015-07-02 03:20:57	rockonx	omg it is puncayshun!

2015-07-02 03:21:01	mew2king	so ppl were like "m2k isnt talented" but then i played alone mostly for 2 years then 3 stocked all the best players in the world lol
2015-07-02 03:21:03	truckjitsu	chillindude also said it was dumb of himself to think that
2015-07-02 03:21:04	mew2king	in 2007
2015-07-02 03:21:07	pxnetrator	Leffen is good not great
2015-07-02 03:21:08	fap2king	He just goes to majors and wins them. so lame Kappa

2015-07-02 03:21:14	pseudonymousmoniker	I can attest to talent being BS; I read at college level in 4th grade and my grades average to high Cs
2015-07-02 03:21:15	egahbh	do you guys think they're gonna do SL early for the race?

2015-07-02 03:22:00	krabpot	hey now, i do respect chillin for being one of the "elders" of smash but lets be honest, he cant handle the current talent

2015-07-02 03:22:54	mew2king	im the most talented if we're talking smash/game ability, i just have other issues, like physical pain, no one to play in 2002-2006, and mental problems
2015-07-02 03:22:56	mew2king	not ability problems
2015-07-02 03:23:00	pseudonymousmoniker	effort >> talent
2015-07-02 03:23:01	mew2king	it depends how you define the word.

2015-07-03 00:10:37	ihgkowz	Journal Entry #69, Day 4 - It's been 20 minutes since the Puncayshun race between the almighty Chess50 began. After pulling a key out of his bosom and pushing it into the luscious, tight enclosure that unlocks the "basement", Mario began to slide his smooth, toned midget plumber body into the hot sandy lands of SSL. As I sit here writing I wonder, "How will chat handle it when Mario has to pound four pillars back to back to back to back?"

2015-07-03 00:17:07	ihgkowz	Why are there jails in the SSL pyramid? Are they sentencing retarded circular wandering marching Goombas to a short lived life in box jail before drowning in sand? Goombas are not even native to SSL. A Goomba or two got a ride on Bowser's dank submarine and found themselves plopped inside and around the ancient pyramid. They don't eat or sleep, have no enemies besides Italian plumbers and poop out money when they kill them. They are the perfect parasite and have no negative impact on the environment. Who'd jail the stupid things?

2015-07-03 00:22:51	ihgkowz	What is a "1-up" mushroom exactly? It is short, green, small, covered in white and green, and has two small, dinky black dots for eyes. Why does a mushroom have eyes? When you pick it up it makes a little "ka-ching" and you get another life. What exactly is "another life"? I am inclined to say Princess Peach is developing futuristic weaponry that uses cloning and mind control technology to replace enemy soldiers with picture perfect, blubbering fatso plumbers. The truth is Mario was a trained Marine warrior from space who was force fed one of these "1-ups" and then put on this obstacle course ruse to save Peach to test the effectiveness of the "1-up" chemical warfare drug.

2015-07-03 01:45:00	gull_ssbm	Oh I getcha, I wouldn't get my hopes up on that since the movement in mario games isn't nearly as fleshed out as it was in 64/sunshine
2015-07-03 01:45:28	egahbh	wasnt there that one guy who was working on a 4d platformer?
2015-07-03 01:45:40	noblesupremacy	Im unaware of that

2015-07-03 01:59:13	pro_tage	@Puncayshun do you have work outside streaming?
2015-07-03 01:59:14	iztikeit	Per sub pay varies too, another reason for the Nda

2015-07-03 01:59:28	aldo_haa	I know donations are his stronges streaming income, but that doesn't mean he won't EVER play an ad.

2015-07-03 02:00:22	arakasi01	I think ads are fine when the streamer is on break.
2015-07-03 02:00:23	pimpmasterfunk	it turns people away when u play ads during gameplay
2015-07-03 02:00:26	iztikeit	Twitch just has bad ads though, I don't mind occasional ads of they aren't garbage
2015-07-03 02:00:28	stevehdd	Lol streaker
2015-07-03 02:00:30	rebbob24	i think people respect when people don't play ads...which means they're going to be more likely to return to the stream and youll be more likely to increase viewers
2015-07-03 02:00:35	mrbisonopolis	isnt there an adblock that still counts as viewing the ad so the streamer still gets some money?
2015-07-03 02:00:39	mrbisonopolis	but you dont see the ad
2015-07-03 02:00:42	pimpmasterfunk	not enough viewers here
2015-07-03 02:00:47	rebbob24	which increases donations and subscriptions
2015-07-03 02:01:14	aldo_haa	Yeah, it's called "ignore the ad, but don't run adblock because you're not an asshole" FUNgineer
2015-07-03 02:01:28	kittiesarefuzzy	PogChamp
2015-07-03 02:01:40	arakasi01	If Twitch didn't use pre-roll ads I would not run adblock.

2015-07-03 02:02:30	kittiesarefuzzy	then we'd have mario and anime ads all day long Kappa

2015-07-03 02:02:34	jimmyboy91198	when ever i get an ad my stream goes mute and i have to refresh. anyon no why ?
2015-07-03 02:02:36	aldo_haa	Well, Twitch has to pay for the service they provide you FOR FREE, and to all his employees

2015-07-03 02:28:12	gull_ssbm	The reason Sig is relevant in the SM64 scene still is because people are uninformed

2015-07-03 02:31:01	stevehdd	Most of all computer programs used a random generator of some kind
2015-07-03 02:31:04	mrbisonopolis	old platformers that are all based on cycles probably lack RNG

2015-07-03 02:31:49	chadwelli	0 star has bljs, those are fairly luck dependent if you wanna get a good spot near each bowser entrance

2015-07-03 02:34:00	gull_ssbm	Pokemon is interesting because you can literally bend it to your will

2015-07-03 02:34:23	mtanglin21	yeah wrester is a mad man
2015-07-03 02:34:27	ceptik	Am I wrong for disliking that cheese is the WR holder? No disrespect to cheese but I feel like Puncay is a way better player and cheese got luck
2015-07-03 02:34:35	bebopbandit	yes you're wrong
2015-07-03 02:34:39	stevehdd	You can bend Pokemon rng because it's pseudo random and needs a seed like all rng

2015-07-03 02:46:47	ceptik	For me puncays WRs seem like a grind and pay off and slow progression. For Cheeses wr it seems more lucky run then anything. Not that he played bad (He played great)

2015-07-03 02:48:11	whitacre	I think he means that Cheese's run was more of an outlier run.

2015-07-04 02:12:58	athlone2012nd	For the raid tier right now, there are some interesting bosses, not a phenomenal tier, but still okay. The difficulty goes LFR -> Normal -> Heroic -> Mythic. Normal and Heroic are flex (10-30 people) and can be cross server. Mythic is locked @ 20 people and only people on your server can go with you.
2015-07-04 02:12:59	denialz_	that horrible mage kumojin'

2015-07-04 02:16:00	athlone2012nd	This xpac is worse than MoP

2015-07-05 04:05:48	tvpvz	like zelda games are really popular but i personally don't like watching them speedrun because i never played them

2015-07-05 04:06:46	ihgkowz	Oh I got an actual question for you: Do signatures from famous people (like nintendo devs or w/e) raise the price a large amount in what you collect? Do you even care about such things personally?
2015-07-05 04:07:01	pistill	Play Sm64ds and get 150 stars or break a random controller and console in your room.

2015-07-05 04:07:27	gull_ssbm	Miyamoto rarely signs stuff so it must raise value on whatever he signs
2015-07-05 04:07:32	ihgkowz	hi Neiru cirThree /
2015-07-05 04:07:55	leuse	How come it says 1:41:28 when your splits are 1:41:24
2015-07-05 04:08:02	mafaraxas	A thousand lol
2015-07-05 04:08:08	mafaraxas	tens of thousands i would bet

2015-07-05 04:08:28	jaketehnub	puncayshun are you jelly that cosmo got to touch miyamoto and you didnt at the NWC
2015-07-05 04:08:31	muffinblight	yeah probably 5 digits

2015-07-05 04:08:42	ihgkowz	Is his signature that rare? I mean, what is the story behind it? punCirno
2015-07-05 04:08:56	gull_ssbm	He just does not sign stuff a lot
2015-07-05 04:09:07	ihgkowz	a grand for that seems a bit much for something that'd I assume is super niche until the actual good is aged or something
2015-07-05 04:09:14	gull_ssbm	I think he usually declines to sign stuff when asked
2015-07-05 04:09:15	toxic456	Its because he doesnt know how to write Kappa 
2015-07-05 04:09:24	ihgkowz	@gull I see, interesting
2015-07-05 04:09:25	thesingular1ty	he's probably just a really humble dude and doesn't feel like he should sign things
2015-07-05 04:09:33	gull_ssbm	His signature is cool as fuck, look it up
2015-07-05 04:09:45	ihgkowz	@toxic writing is tough and I don't blame him Kappa
2015-07-05 04:10:01	jaketehnub	his signature looks like a pair of tits
2015-07-05 04:10:18	gull_ssbm	I think the reason he declines is because he doesn't want people selling and buying it yeah
2015-07-05 04:10:27	oficialsqngames	puncay sign would raise a controller price for 999%
2015-07-05 04:10:29	kazakuri	puncay will you sign my anime body pillow?

2015-07-05 04:10:48	jellyfishswimmer	ya like he would only sign it if he knows you are going to appreciate it and keep it
2015-07-05 04:11:01	24isgoat	ill buy it for 5 with no signatyre
2015-07-05 04:11:04	strong_badam	puncay will u sign my brests

2015-07-05 04:38:05	bakerawwr	Beats by Dre cost about $14 to produce

2015-07-05 04:39:07	thesingular1ty	this is pretty good if you want a mic + headphones http://www.amazon.com/HyperX-Cloud-Gaming-Headset-KHX-H3CL/dp/B00JJNQG98
2015-07-05 04:39:15	ihgkowz	dont get a headset
2015-07-05 04:39:17	ihgkowz	dont do eeeet
2015-07-05 04:39:23	ihgkowz	Headphones + mic = lyfe
2015-07-05 04:39:31	thesingular1ty	its value unless you want a studio mic
2015-07-05 04:39:31	godoodoo	you have to decide if you want open or closed headphones
2015-07-05 04:39:45	ihgkowz	You sacrifice so much quality and durability for the conjunction function of a microphone and headphone
2015-07-05 04:39:51	ihgkowz	yes that is fuzziness lmao
2015-07-05 04:40:35	processingerror	There's really no basis to claim headsets are necessarily inferior.
2015-07-05 04:40:50	ihgkowz	Have you heard of Translucent Propped Beat-jump?
2015-07-05 04:40:53	peteyboo	for the price, they're worse
2015-07-05 04:41:06	ihgkowz	You shouldn't have because I made it up. That's how fucking dumb these genres are getting Kappa
2015-07-05 04:41:32	jellyfishswimmer	puncayshun do you listen to nightcore?
2015-07-05 04:41:52	ihgkowz	@process a blue snowball mic + sennheiser 598's duo quality will ramp up to like 300-400+ for a headset
2015-07-05 04:41:58	ihgkowz	You're reaching studio levels at that point
2015-07-05 04:42:01	processingerror	A headset is literally a separate microphone and headphones glued together. Some of them don't even share cabling.
2015-07-05 04:42:08	godoodoo	good choice pun PogChamp 
2015-07-05 04:42:12	ihgkowz	Its actually physically difficult to fit a good microphone and headphone all in one
2015-07-05 04:42:23	mrcaptainodd	no more runs?
2015-07-05 04:42:47	peteyboo	error, you won't fit a good microphone on your head. It's not possible
2015-07-05 04:42:49	godoodoo	make sure to get open headphones. they sound much better imho
2015-07-05 04:42:56	patrickmanx	furcayshun

2015-07-05 04:43:41	ihgkowz	TBH I switched to only posting them when your chat is slower than two igloos in a melting competition in Alaska
2015-07-05 04:43:42	processingerror	The only physical difficulty is the weight of the microphone, which has nothing to do with it being a headset.
2015-07-05 04:43:46	hyakujuunokaido	i guess that biinny's WR is unbeatable KappaPride
2015-07-05 04:43:50	tonyforprez	more runs???
2015-07-05 04:44:01	godoodoo	yeah talking bout sennheiser
2015-07-05 04:44:17	pot_up	who won the race?
2015-07-05 04:44:25	ihgkowz	Okay I will explain open and closed to you real quick cuz you sound confused
2015-07-05 04:44:29	peteyboo	Well, you can use your silly boom mic and I'll continue to use my much better one cirThree
2015-07-05 04:44:37	danetrainz	@pot_up pun did
2015-07-05 04:44:50	processingerror	You can get a headset where the quality far exceeds whatever shitty compression Twitch uses.
2015-07-05 04:44:50	pot_up	noice
2015-07-05 04:45:01	ihgkowz	Open = sound stage is larger. Closed = smaller. What that means in short means closed headphones make the sound seem like it originates from inside your ear/head where open make it sound like it is coming from outside your ear
2015-07-05 04:45:06	peteyboo	Yes, but for how much money?
2015-07-05 04:45:07	ihgkowz	Open have superior quality
2015-07-05 04:45:09	processingerror	For probably $40
2015-07-05 04:45:12	ihgkowz	and cause less ear damage
2015-07-05 04:45:16	ihgkowz	and are just better
2015-07-05 04:45:19	peteyboo	lol $40
2015-07-05 04:45:40	melwon	stream over?
2015-07-05 04:45:46	ihgkowz	but they have the drawback that they have zero noise reduction going in or out - people can hear muffled bits of what you hear and you can hear them as if you weren't wearing  headphones at all
2015-07-05 04:45:57	ihgkowz	It isn't bad
2015-07-05 04:46:08	ihgkowz	I could watch porn at normal volume and no one could tell its porn unless they were 2 feet from me
2015-07-05 04:46:25	ihgkowz	People WILL hear your headphones, but they wont hear what the heck is actually playing
2015-07-05 04:46:36	ihgkowz	but it is not that bad tbh
2015-07-05 04:46:46	ihgkowz	Wyatt is too far away to hear it most of the time for instance
2015-07-05 04:46:47	godoodoo	oh and take care that you don't get fake ones. they are everywhere 
2015-07-05 04:47:20	ihgkowz	TBH with sennheiser 598's if you're running it at the proper sound levels since its 60OHMz it should not be that annoying even at cap volume for anyone further than 5 feet from you
2015-07-05 04:47:45	processingerror	Twitch forces 160 audio bitrate, I'm pretty sure a tin can and string can do that.
2015-07-05 04:47:49	ihgkowz	Don't worry about the sound leak, its really the least important issue
2015-07-05 04:47:50	gunraykilla	So are we gonna get to see some Puncaydick or what Kappa
2015-07-05 04:47:50	peteyboo	Is OHMz resistance + frequency? zigBoo
2015-07-05 04:48:01	ihgkowz	The BIG issue is that you hear other shit
2015-07-05 04:48:19	ihgkowz	open vs closed? yes
2015-07-05 04:48:22	ihgkowz	fucking huge imo
2015-07-05 04:48:26	gunraykilla	Open sounds a lot mroe natural
2015-07-05 04:48:27	gunraykilla	and crisp
2015-07-05 04:48:32	gunraykilla	Closed is super muddy
2015-07-05 04:48:36	ihgkowz	IMO Open sounds 50% better
2015-07-05 04:48:37	yetispapa	What is he doing?
2015-07-05 04:48:47	peteyboo	just get both and use closed for porn Kappa b
2015-07-05 04:48:58	gunraykilla	Thats why i liked Astros
2015-07-05 04:49:04	gunraykilla	But they're super loud for everybody around me.
2015-07-05 04:49:11	gunraykilla	even at medium volume they can hear everything.
2015-07-05 04:49:28	gbot322	uh oh
2015-07-05 04:49:45	ihgkowz	Summary: Open = the way to go UNLESS you will be annoyed by sounds around you like family, exploding animals, kitchen stuff, tvs, etc.
2015-07-05 04:49:56	ihgkowz	also if you wanna go the full mile get a sound card
2015-07-05 04:50:06	ihgkowz	dont get a great one, just anything that isn't an onboard sound card
2015-07-05 04:50:07	gbot322	I missed a 2012 playback pb?
2015-07-05 04:50:10	godoodoo	if he doesn't care about sound quality he can just get some cheap closed ones. for sm64 sound quality is not that important Kappa 
2015-07-05 04:50:10	ihgkowz	it makes SOOO MUCH of a difference
2015-07-05 04:50:19	gbot322	jk lol
2015-07-05 04:50:36	ihgkowz	also be sure to plug your headphones directly into your sound card when you get one or if you already have it because plugging it into the front of your case or anything but the sound card will cause interference
2015-07-05 04:50:43	ihgkowz	because your computer parts actually cause interference
2015-07-05 04:50:58	ihgkowz	I'm not an audiophile, but I do like my sound being as good as it can be
2015-07-05 04:51:11	foxslink7	or get a dac-amp
2015-07-05 04:51:14	frostedambassador	external DACs are better than sound cards
2015-07-05 04:51:20	godoodoo	you can get really good ones for 50$ i guess
2015-07-05 04:51:22	ihgkowz	I'm not even an expert by any means. I'm spouting super basic shit anyone who knows their salt would consider rudimentary
2015-07-05 04:51:30	gbot322	things can always be better
2015-07-05 04:51:41	gbot322	like a 1:40
2015-07-05 04:51:44	ihgkowz	@frosted a 20-30$ soundcard can go a long way tho
2015-07-05 04:51:52	ihgkowz	gives you tons of options too on your pc to fiddle with the sound
2015-07-05 04:52:10	ihgkowz	Good point - you need a plane ticket or some shit still anyways Keepo
2015-07-05 04:52:24	ihgkowz	My tip: save your audio stuff for alter
2015-07-05 04:52:26	gbot322	das not wassup JKanStyle
2015-07-05 04:52:35	ihgkowz	Buy a new mic, headphones, and a soundcard all at once
2015-07-05 04:52:39	ihgkowz	or all in a short span of time
2015-07-05 04:52:45	gunraykilla	whos running sm64 at sgdq?
2015-07-05 04:52:49	ihgkowz	for mics I would recommend blue snowball/yeti's
2015-07-05 04:52:59	ihgkowz	not super expensive, but still good
2015-07-05 04:53:06	frostedambassador	he has a snowball ice
2015-07-05 04:53:10	ihgkowz	its a race gunray

2015-07-05 04:53:14	ihgkowz	oh shit nice
2015-07-05 04:53:27	gunraykilla	Audio Technica mics are great.
2015-07-05 04:53:46	ihgkowz	Your mic is okay, but this is twitch
2015-07-05 04:53:48	gunraykilla	If you're closer up and use a pop filter it will sound great.
2015-07-05 04:53:49	ihgkowz	twitch is fucking twitch
2015-07-05 04:53:52	ihgkowz	its audio is shit anyways
2015-07-05 04:53:56	gunraykilla	twitch also limits to like 168k
2015-07-05 04:54:00	ihgkowz	in mumble or w/e I would probably be able to tell better
2015-07-05 04:54:07	jellyfishswimmer	phil just finished

Und liegt vom Kampfe in Trümmern Die ganze Welt zuhauf, Das soll uns den Teufel kümmern, Wir bauen sie wieder auf. Und mögen die Alten auch schelten, So laßt sie nur toben und schrei'n, Und stemmen sich gegen uns Welten, Wir werden doch Sieger sein. Sie wollen das Lied nicht begreifen, Sie denken an Knechtschaft und Krieg Derweil unsere Äcker reifen, Du Fahne der Freiheit, flieg! Wir werden weiter marschieren, Wenn alles in Scherben fällt; Die Freiheit stand auf in Deutschland Und morgen gehört ihr die Welt.

He'd cry on Mario's shoulders then they would watch netflix and eat pizza together at Luigi's pad. Maybe play some Super Mario World for the SNES to meta it up

2015-07-06 03:11:07	ihgkowz	Mario supports information control and dictatorships. Mario killing books is evidence of that.

2015-07-06 04:05:10	improv666	with smash its not the game that sucks, its the players
2015-07-06 04:05:10	fighter_boy4real	Not true melee is the best because it truly does take the most skill but smash 4 is fun when you just want to chill
2015-07-06 04:05:11	hodorus	that was smooth
2015-07-06 04:05:13	pookudar	12.8
2015-07-06 04:05:13	iztikeit	Melee is more air based than any fg I'm aware of
2015-07-06 04:05:15	izanami99	I prefer melee by far but don't care if people decide to play smash 4 and don't understnad why anyone would
2015-07-06 04:05:15	daparagon	Neither Leffen nor Mango thinks smash 4 is bad, they just don't enjoy it on a competitive level.
2015-07-06 04:05:16	mariopartywbeer	whereas in sm4sh all the powerful attacks tend to be aerial attack
2015-07-06 04:05:21	izanami99	I'm great at tech in melee
2015-07-06 04:05:22	gull_ssbm	@iztikeit competitive smash is barely supported by the developers in comparison to fighting games
2015-07-06 04:05:24	openssl	Okay take care you autistic little girls. Love you all. Continue spreading the word of puncay. Bye <3
2015-07-06 04:05:28	izanami99	but not very good at actually playing
2015-07-06 04:05:39	marcustellis	sm4sh is fun, but when i play it it makes me wanna play melee haha
2015-07-06 04:05:42	fighter_boy4real	@izanami99 name one advanced technique

2015-07-06 04:05:56	harveybirdmano	i dont like smash 4 so i dont play it and leave it at that
2015-07-06 04:05:58	mariopartywbeer	if you find the right group of people all that hard tech skill gets grinded out and you dont even notice
2015-07-06 04:05:58	fighter_boy4real	Noice
2015-07-06 04:06:00	iztikeit	Ledge dashing is hard to be consistent

2015-07-06 04:06:02	gull_ssbm	@iztikeit I think smash 4 and brawl are like the face and target of that frustration

2015-07-06 04:06:26	mariopartywbeer	no
2015-07-06 04:06:27	quandiverous	Ledge dashing is pretty precise, and you have to do it quickly so you retain the maximum amount of invincibility
2015-07-06 04:06:28	scydris	Revival of brawl please
2015-07-06 04:06:30	luigilovesyou	ledge dashing with fox is broken
2015-07-06 04:06:30	bronzecommander	This is a quickjog
2015-07-06 04:06:32	improv666	but ledge invincibility bro
2015-07-06 04:06:33	harveybirdmano	its only possible with fox falco and maybe falcon? but its super precise
2015-07-06 04:06:36	izanami99	I hate ledge dashing 
2015-07-06 04:06:37	iztikeit	Invincible ledge dash is OP though
2015-07-06 04:06:37	fighter_boy4real	Ledge dashing is a necessity for high lvl play
2015-07-06 04:06:38	luigilovesyou	you get to do an invincible move
2015-07-06 04:06:39	its_nico	Im good at ledge dashing but struggle with perfect shine cancels
2015-07-06 04:06:47	gull_ssbm	I spent a couple hours working on fox movement today and I actually had a lot of fun just grinding it out
2015-07-06 04:06:51	izanami99	I love shield drops
2015-07-06 04:06:52	gunraykilla	So are we gonna see some hot Puncay dick in here or not? Kappa

2015-07-06 04:07:03	inverno_	all smash games are equally bad. :)
2015-07-06 04:07:10	mariopartywbeer	s2j isnt human
2015-07-06 04:07:11	harveybirdmano	s2j's falcon is so Kreygasm
2015-07-06 04:07:15	mariopartywbeer	he's a robot
2015-07-06 04:07:18	mariopartywbeer	with swag
2015-07-06 04:07:25	iztikeit	Mango doesn't ledge land was well as other top players that use it
2015-07-06 04:07:25	daparagon	I'm not bad at tech, but not particularly great, but I'm super consistant at ledge dashing
2015-07-06 04:07:26	stugbug	Woah when did the 1:41:24 happen?
2015-07-06 04:07:27	harveybirdmano	ive played him a bit in friendlies its stupid
2015-07-06 04:07:30	izanami99	I main puff but she's so boring to play alone so when I don't have people to play against I just practice fox tech for fun
2015-07-06 04:07:32	gull_ssbm	You really just have to spend a lot of time in-game and pushing yourself to go faster and faster
2015-07-06 04:07:35	gunraykilla	Watching M2K, Mango, and Leffen are just pure orgasm. They're so fluid.
2015-07-06 04:07:41	bronzecommander	Are we gonna bop cheese Kappa
2015-07-06 04:07:43	mariopartywbeer	consistency breeds growth in melee
2015-07-06 04:07:43	fighter_boy4real	@I ztikeit I play luigi as a pocket so I get invincible ledge dash frames across the whole stage
2015-07-06 04:07:46	mal1t1a	@Puncayshun when do you stop reading chat during a run?
2015-07-06 04:07:55	daparagon	@Puncayshun Have you ever seen the movement of dutch falcon player Jeapie? 
2015-07-06 04:07:56	its_nico	Armada peach rip
2015-07-06 04:07:57	harveybirdmano	my favorite player to watch is westbawlz though
2015-07-06 04:08:02	mariopartywbeer	jeapie is the best
2015-07-06 04:08:05	iztikeit	How far does that work Fighter?
2015-07-06 04:08:05	scydris	lol that controller is adorable.
2015-07-06 04:08:05	izanami99	jeapie came to my school
2015-07-06 04:08:05	maxidope	wizz falcon at FC was slackin
2015-07-06 04:08:09	popcorncook1	wow perfect bowser

2015-07-06 04:08:13	izanami99	he was a really cool guy
2015-07-06 04:08:17	gull_ssbm	Leffen ledge dashes a LOT and it helps him get out of some situations
2015-07-06 04:08:18	setothegreat	crotch cam tho Kreygasm
2015-07-06 04:08:20	debaykin	westballz has a good falco
2015-07-06 04:08:23	fighter_boy4real	Yo west has the craziest shine pressure ever
2015-07-06 04:08:24	iztikeit	I mean how far into luigis ledge dash does he lose invincibility
2015-07-06 04:08:29	mariopartywbeer	westballz techskill is too good
2015-07-06 04:08:34	quandiverous	Funnily enough, Fox has better ledgedash options than luigi because of his heavy weight.
2015-07-06 04:08:35	rombie_	M2K has all this shit about his hands yet he is still going to small tourneys.
2015-07-06 04:08:35	harveybirdmano	westbawlz falco has the most sex
2015-07-06 04:08:41	fighter_boy4real	M2k Marty is god like
2015-07-06 04:08:47	fighter_boy4real	Marth
2015-07-06 04:08:49	iztikeit	Marth up air OOs is OP
2015-07-06 04:08:50	gunraykilla	Thats why hes so good
2015-07-06 04:08:55	gunraykilla	Marth is such a great character
2015-07-06 04:09:00	mariopartywbeer	it is
2015-07-06 04:09:04	gunraykilla	His wave dash just feels amazing to me i dont know why
2015-07-06 04:09:04	izanami99	I hate playing against marth
2015-07-06 04:09:07	mariopartywbeer	i like the air wobbles marth can do
2015-07-06 04:09:08	harveybirdmano	yea most of marths combos are up air based
2015-07-06 04:09:09	ihgkowz	watch m2k marth uptilt, upair, into fair/dair spikes is fucking cool - I REALLY want to play melee just do that shit
2015-07-06 04:09:11	fighter_boy4real	Marths up air is really good for juggling spaceys
2015-07-06 04:09:13	mariopartywbeer	he will juggle you till you cant move
2015-07-06 04:09:16	improv666	take em to the fair
2015-07-06 04:09:17	harveybirdmano	with platform tech chases and such
2015-07-06 04:09:19	stratta23	no one can marth combo like m2k does
2015-07-06 04:09:19	luigilovesyou	up air is super good vs fast faller
2015-07-06 04:09:20	ultigus	why did he just switch controls during the bowser fight
2015-07-06 04:09:24	topherb	its hard to chain up airs while reacting to di, i struggle with the same shit lol
2015-07-06 04:09:33	iztikeit	The hitbox of uair comes out so fast
2015-07-06 04:09:43	xxpatalusxx	@puncayshun the small controller is for Bowser only?
2015-07-06 04:09:45	gunraykilla	I wish i was good at smash but i don't have the desire and motivation to get gud
2015-07-06 04:09:48	harveybirdmano	yea marth combing takes a lot of experience compared to other top tiers
2015-07-06 04:09:51	improv666	yeah punchay why do you favor the hori controller for bowser fights?
2015-07-06 04:09:52	gunraykilla	its like that for SM64 too
2015-07-06 04:09:52	gull_ssbm	Puncayshun do you have the 20xx mod? The bots DI randomly so it's good practice for punishes
2015-07-06 04:09:52	chausies	falco mains ftw Kreygasm
2015-07-06 04:09:57	phantom_ghoti	for better stick control.
2015-07-06 04:10:01	harveybirdmano	because of the way the sword hits change
2015-07-06 04:10:02	gunraykilla	I'd love to run SM64 but im naturally Terribad at Video Games.
2015-07-06 04:10:03	chrescendo	Joystick on the Hori is a lot better for throwing.
2015-07-06 04:10:03	mariopartywbeer	 m2k has the same habit; he grabs a spacie up throws him chaingrab until like 30 percent then he juggles 
2015-07-06 04:10:08	mariopartywbeer	then downair thats a stock
2015-07-06 04:10:15	gummyplatypus	every weaboo mains marth lol
2015-07-06 04:10:18	phantom_ghoti	lots of spin on bowser
2015-07-06 04:10:30	izanami99	I'm gonna be the best smash player in the world 
2015-07-06 04:10:34	mikel_ac	I used to have this game on my wii and my ds
2015-07-06 04:10:42	fighter_boy4real	The main thing to get better at smash is to have people to play with
2015-07-06 04:10:50	iztikeit	Fact

2015-07-06 04:10:59	rombie_	@Izanami99 HAHAHAHA
2015-07-06 04:11:06	ihgkowz	Puncay would you ever consider playing/getting SSB4?
2015-07-06 04:11:07	oyajitchi	Not talked about much
2015-07-06 04:11:09	izanami99	shouldn't be too hard
2015-07-06 04:11:16	l1ghtaluc4rd	controls suck on it @oy'
2015-07-06 04:11:17	mariopartywbeer	melee is the single hardest game i've ever tried to get good at
2015-07-06 04:11:21	zeldaalttp	the DS version is the best one and has 150 stars
2015-07-06 04:11:24	daparagon	http://www.gfycat.com/DiligentBronzeFalcon Disgusting Marth combo <3 
2015-07-06 04:11:24	ferrero64	did he really lost time at all?
2015-07-06 04:11:31	gunraykilla	Oh puncay i have an honest question.
2015-07-06 04:11:36	gunraykilla	Why havent you joined the RGB Club yet?
2015-07-06 04:11:37	oyajitchi	Eh you get used to it. Especially if you replay it on 3DS
2015-07-06 04:11:51	mertagne	Yeah I don't see how you lose time of koopa hasn't gotten to the top yet
2015-07-06 04:11:56	l1ghtaluc4rd	dont like holding a button to run on mario 64
2015-07-06 04:12:00	mertagne	*if
2015-07-06 04:12:04	ihgkowz	Koopa finishes the race faster once u reach the top
2015-07-06 04:12:07	fighter_boy4real	If you got free time go on YouTube and watch 1000 m2k ledge guards with marth
2015-07-06 04:12:08	debaykin	that combo was amazing
2015-07-06 04:12:10	giraffeandmore	he has no component cable gunray
2015-07-06 04:12:15	its_nico	That was nasty
2015-07-06 04:12:16	gull_ssbm	@mertagne Koopa speeds up when you get to the goal
2015-07-06 04:12:17	wh0e	hands stream Kreygasm 
2015-07-06 04:12:17	izanami99	smash bros for the 64 is my favorite
2015-07-06 04:12:23	ihgkowz	He realizes you aren't a fucking turtle like him and chugs along a bit quicker because he is a polite guy
2015-07-06 04:12:25	chausies	ganon is my favourite smash character
2015-07-06 04:12:26	potatode	are these new strats?
2015-07-06 04:12:30	its_nico	0 to death real quick
2015-07-06 04:12:33	tarsii	does the koopa's speed vary based on your position?
2015-07-06 04:12:34	chausies	seeing good ganon's play in tourneys is Kreygasm
2015-07-06 04:12:35	iztikeit	Ganon in melee is fun af
2015-07-06 04:12:40	gunraykilla	@Giraffeandmore you have to mod your N64 too lol
2015-07-06 04:12:44	zeldaalttp	Smash Bros on Wii U is the best and has tons of music
2015-07-06 04:12:49	iztikeit	My first main was ganon, noob stomper
2015-07-06 04:12:56	egahbh	that punRNG PogChamp
2015-07-06 04:13:02	izanami99	My first main was also ganon
2015-07-06 04:13:03	falconkneebrah	I've played melee competitively for over 2 and a half years now
2015-07-06 04:13:03	ihgkowz	I really want to get a Wii U for smash. I play it on my 3ds and love it
2015-07-06 04:13:07	izanami99	then Luigi and now puff
2015-07-06 04:13:08	l1ghtaluc4rd	I was disappointed with how little smash u had for unlocks 
2015-07-06 04:13:14	fighter_boy4real	Bizzaro flame fan boy?
2015-07-06 04:13:18	l1ghtaluc4rd	not really fun after beating the 3ds version'
2015-07-06 04:13:20	gunraykilla	I really don't like Smash U compared to Smash Melee
2015-07-06 04:13:20	ihgkowz	only problem with smash 4 is several characters are just outright not fun to play against
2015-07-06 04:13:21	chausies	I want to see bizzaroflame beat a god with his ganon BibleThump
2015-07-06 04:13:26	gunraykilla	I just dont like how slow it is 
2015-07-06 04:13:29	egahbh	3ds version of smash is way way way way infinitely way worse than wii u
2015-07-06 04:13:36	debaykin	my first main was pichu because I thought the pilot outfit was cool
2015-07-06 04:13:37	egahbh	like why did they even bother other than everybody has a 3ds
2015-07-06 04:13:38	ferrero64	why?
2015-07-06 04:13:39	oyajitchi	I didn't like the lack of a story mode for Smash4,
2015-07-06 04:13:39	gull_ssbm	@falconkneebrah netplay me sometime
2015-07-06 04:13:39	l1ghtaluc4rd	its the same game lol
2015-07-06 04:13:40	its_nico	Smash for Wii U is fun but rewards bad players and the tech is almost completely barren of skill
2015-07-06 04:13:41	chausies	it we be so hype to see a ganon play perfect and hand some ass to some gods
2015-07-06 04:13:43	ferrero64	its the same game
2015-07-06 04:13:44	izanami99	pichu is cute
2015-07-06 04:13:44	lustghoul	bizz took a game off armada
2015-07-06 04:13:47	fighter_boy4real	Any one who plays puff I have no respect for sorry
2015-07-06 04:14:01	izanami99	I don't care :P
2015-07-06 04:14:02	l1ghtaluc4rd	at first 3ds and wii u were going to be cross play 
2015-07-06 04:14:02	wh0e	Kreygasm Kreygasm 
2015-07-06 04:14:04	fighter_boy4real	It takes little tech skill and mainly gimmicks
2015-07-06 04:14:08	iztikeit	Joe bushman was the og ganon
2015-07-06 04:14:08	cog_mvg_lol_m2k	closest he'd get is beating armada's fox in a set but he would just go peach after losing since peach ganon is like 90-10
2015-07-06 04:14:09	ferrero64	pls lets not talk about smash 4
2015-07-06 04:14:09	grandcathedral	Puncay go lil nigg go
2015-07-06 04:14:14	gunraykilla	I really cant keep up with how much they patch the Wii U version
2015-07-06 04:14:16	zeldaalttp	I don't understand how people who have a Wii U can even buy Smash on 3DS

2015-07-06 04:14:44	giraffeandmore	4 is slow if you make it slow. zero plays quick and aggressive
2015-07-06 04:14:45	izanami99	if she is easy why are there no good puffs besides hbox?
2015-07-06 04:14:47	gunraykilla	Sonic is like my favorite character but now hes like dead
2015-07-06 04:14:47	x_rok	ganon was my main back in the day
2015-07-06 04:14:53	x_rok	with a pocket jigglypuff
2015-07-06 04:15:01	fighter_boy4real	Puff is the easiest top tier melee character to play because it's all about gimmicks
2015-07-06 04:15:02	debaykin	because there are better characters
2015-07-06 04:15:03	ddevengencie	sonics dash attack too stronk

2015-07-06 04:15:17	gunraykilla	Sonic's Dash Side A is pretty awesome though
2015-07-06 04:15:18	daparagon	People don't want to play puff because she's not that fun to play. Hungrybox plays Puff at least partly because he sucks dick with most other characters
2015-07-06 04:15:18	gunraykilla	It hurts

2015-07-06 04:20:41	thezahni	puff is EZ high tier character
2015-07-06 04:20:45	mariopartywbeer	puff has rest when you get good enough at it its not hard to get your run of the mill smasher to fall for it

2015-07-06 04:21:42	theryanneighbor	puff is a character with a very low tech skill requirement. She's easy to learn, but not easy to master.
2015-07-06 04:21:47	quandiverous	Spacing, mind games, and neutral are not "easy". Furthermore, puff dies very early for many characters, and missing a rest costs you a stick a lot of the time.

2015-07-06 04:22:07	indigojarl	ssb sucks Kappa
2015-07-06 04:22:07	giraffeandmore	puff is hard because she uses more fighting game fundamentals at a lower level
2015-07-06 04:22:07	ihgkowz	@egah he wouldnt mid air jump. He would ground pound and each subsequent jump would be higher for larger height and stronger ground pounds
2015-07-06 04:22:12	giraffeandmore	fox is harder because literally everyone begins learning melee by playing against foc
2015-07-06 04:22:19	avointwitch	Puff is easy as fuck. If you're good at smash you can play her and be decent by default. Ofc every character has skill cap though.
2015-07-06 04:22:20	theryanneighbor	to succeed with puff you have to actually be good at the game, make reads and understand opponents habits
2015-07-06 04:22:23	iztikeit	My point is, if puff were easy more would play her....because people want to win
2015-07-06 04:22:24	gotonis	I occasionally use Puff casually, but I mostly just spam rollout
2015-07-06 04:22:27	fighter_boy4real	Dude mango played puff originally I'm not saying it's a bad character I'm just saying it's the top tier that takes the least amount of skill

2015-07-06 04:24:12	gotonis	When you hear somebody mention the word "tiers", the first thing to do is shout " TIERS R 4 QUEERS"
2015-07-06 04:24:13	dirtnasty94	and don't get me started on smash 5
2015-07-06 04:24:16	seckswrecks	yeah like, tiers make no sense in a game where matchups are so different
2015-07-06 04:24:19	gotonis	Then you have one of 4 options:
2015-07-06 04:24:22	egahbh	gotonis OMGScoots
2015-07-06 04:24:24	gotonis	Hit them with the wiimote
2015-07-06 04:24:26	aldo_haa	Yeah, and Melee's tier list has been pretty much the same for the last 10 years
2015-07-06 04:24:30	gotonis	Hit them with the wiimote and nunchuck
2015-07-06 04:24:31	dirtnasty94	you cant even z roll out of a tech slide
2015-07-06 04:24:32	oyajitchi	You missed that coversation @Copterskates 
2015-07-06 04:24:34	dirtnasty94	its a shit game
2015-07-06 04:24:37	gotonis	hit them with the classic controller
2015-07-06 04:24:41	gotonis	hit them with the gamecube controller
2015-07-06 04:24:42	gull_ssbm	I actually think Falcon is harder to play than Fox but I may just be crazy
2015-07-06 04:24:44	wh0e	Kreygasm 
2015-07-06 04:24:45	iztikeit	Smash games have shit balance,  that's just fact
2015-07-06 04:24:50	quandiverous	The tier list is based on matchups
2015-07-06 04:24:51	dr_locker	WHat about the WIiU pad?
2015-07-06 04:24:54	mizu3142	yoshi climbed up the past time I checked the tierlist Kappa
2015-07-06 04:24:54	gotonis	if you're using a wireless gamecube controller take the battery out and shove it in their eye

2015-07-06 04:25:16	iztikeit	Ahhh
2015-07-06 04:25:18	daparagon	Tiers are more significant in Melee and smash in general. The frame data differ a lot in smash, making a whole bunch of the characters completely unviable regardless of how god damn skilled you are. There's also matchups though 
2015-07-06 04:25:22	dirtnasty94	what if puncay pops a chubby right here on stream
2015-07-06 04:25:22	war0blade	crotch cam Kreygasm
2015-07-06 04:25:23	egahbh	you forgot that people who dont play the game competitively exist

2015-07-06 04:25:27	its_nico	The good thing about Smash is it's balanced before the game comes out unfortunately now though they constantly are patching characters ruining matchups and changing the meta
2015-07-06 04:25:28	kevlar009	No fighting game is balanced, there's always low tier characters
2015-07-06 04:25:29	egahbh	and they're gross DansGame

2015-07-06 04:25:36	fighter_boy4real	True that
2015-07-06 04:25:41	mariopartywbeer	the reason why smash tier lists are so big is because of melee theory

2015-07-06 04:25:47	avointwitch	is this a record run or are you just happy to see me? Kreygasm
2015-07-06 04:25:47	copterskates	has anyone with a crotch cam ever popped a boner on stream?
2015-07-06 04:25:50	mariopartywbeer	people theory craft the shit out of melee
2015-07-06 04:25:50	iztikeit	That's one reason smash gets a bit old for me, always the same characters for the most part.  Games play out similarly
2015-07-06 04:26:00	seckswrecks	yeah its such a bad thing that they're making the game balanced

2015-07-06 04:26:58	dirtnasty94	meta change is literaly the same thing as a content update. When you add or change shit, THINGS CHANGE, MIND BLOWN

2015-07-06 04:27:05	aldo_haa	The thing is that they're only nerfing the "best" characters, instead of making the others a bit better... Why have an all-shit character roster?! EleGiggle
2015-07-06 04:27:07	kevlar009	Evo is the best time to watch for different characters, someone always has a favorite pick from throughout the roster

2015-07-06 04:28:20	oyajitchi	Smash was designed with a casual design in mind to make it easily accessible, but it can be played competitively as well  
2015-07-06 04:28:21	fighter_boy4real	God mode achieved
2015-07-06 04:28:21	daparagon	Leffen is considered top 3 - 4 in the world atm 
2015-07-06 04:28:23	mariopartywbeer	the reason why the meta has developed so well is because of how consistent and constant the game has been

2015-07-06 04:31:38	dangerouskate	Armada got first in every regional before Ceo
2015-07-06 04:31:40	ihgkowz	Feels like Leffen and Armada are in a different league compared to everyone else and Mango on a good day is the only one able to breach that gap. PPMD I have no idea as he hasn't played in awhile, but he should pose a threat to Leffen at the least

2015-07-06 04:32:21	giantenemygoomba	leffen is 3 at least. it's kinda hard cause PP doesn't go to shit but he's obviously gonna still kill it at whatever he enters
2015-07-06 04:32:23	mojo_monkey	definitely top 3, debatably top 1
2015-07-06 04:32:31	gummyplatypus	everyone's so high on PP, it'll be pretty funny when he gets 4th at evo because of rust
2015-07-06 04:32:33	fighter_boy4real	If mango is trying and even having a decent day he is unstoppable

2015-07-06 04:33:10	daparagon	@Mariopartywbeer He won Beast V, national, although it took place in Europe. He also won CEO 2015, which should be considered a national since it had over 450 entries
2015-07-06 04:33:12	giantenemygoomba	hbox vs armada today was fucking hilarious

2015-07-06 04:33:22	daparagon	The last real BIG tournament Hbox won was apex 2010 
2015-07-06 04:33:33	iztikeit	Number of entrants doesn't matter, how many in the top 20 attend matters more
2015-07-06 04:33:40	mariopartywbeer	@Daparagon thanks for the clarity
2015-07-06 04:33:41	gummyplatypus	Hbox could have won sandstorm, but choked away his set against armada
2015-07-06 04:33:44	plamor	Uhh paragon had armada leffen m2k and others
2015-07-06 04:33:46	gull_ssbm	@iztikeit truth
2015-07-06 04:34:02	izanami99	it's so hard being a puff in a fox dominated world

2015-07-06 04:34:14	besthd123	Restart while you can lol
2015-07-06 04:34:27	iztikeit	A top 8 double round robin would determine who is the best
2015-07-06 04:34:29	saucepan47	mango also wasnt at paragon
2015-07-06 04:34:29	war0blade	I BELIEVE \ KappaPride /
2015-07-06 04:34:31	gull_ssbm	@iztikeit I honestly think having more than 500 at a tourney is trivial since its like 90% pools
2015-07-06 04:34:32	plamor	Once hbox goes into semi retirement after this summer who will be our puff god?
2015-07-06 04:34:33	oyajitchi	lol Puncay put on a little more pressure why dont ya?
2015-07-06 04:34:38	panzearon	OH BABY

2015-07-06 04:37:28	oyajitchi	Yes ice
2015-07-06 04:37:29	mariopartywbeer	he needed a nap
2015-07-06 04:37:31	gunraykilla	I'm hungover too Mario LOL

2015-07-06 04:37:41	iztikeit	Drinking is still a factor, not a good excuse
2015-07-06 04:37:43	icebaginjury	People sware that mango is this undefeated person
2015-07-06 04:37:44	izanami99	mango is kind of fucked against armada in the character counterpick game
2015-07-06 04:37:46	icebaginjury	he loses all the time
2015-07-06 04:37:50	icebaginjury	he wins when he needs to
2015-07-06 04:37:52	icebaginjury	and when it counts
2015-07-06 04:38:01	iztikeit	Except when he doesn't
2015-07-06 04:38:03	icebaginjury	Look up his tourney history from last year
2015-07-06 04:38:06	daparagon	Hilariously enough, Mango has a better / higher competitive match making rank than at least one of the players for Cloud 9's CS:GO team. Mainly because he barely played MM, plays ESEA instead, but still, it's funny.. 
2015-07-06 04:38:06	mariopartywbeer	he went to an angels game the day before and on a hangover flys to norcal and plays melee
2015-07-06 04:38:06	icebaginjury	very similar
2015-07-06 04:38:17	gull_ssbm	Definitely not an excuse but I don't think mangos potential has ever faded, his efforts are just spotty
2015-07-06 04:38:24	mariopartywbeer	he got drunk as hell at the ballgame
2015-07-06 04:38:25	brando25844	what is TAS WR for 120?

2015-07-06 04:39:27	mariopartywbeer	yeah theres no really downplaying it but he's still successful so that sheilds you somewhat
2015-07-06 04:39:28	hahasniper1	i've never seen that happen
2015-07-06 04:39:32	oyajitchi	I'm so predictable

2015-07-06 04:40:01	themaster627	to be fair WR can happen in a race too...
2015-07-06 04:40:07	trysping	every speed run is a wr attempt
2015-07-06 04:40:22	gull_ssbm	Puncay I think getting at least a single 1:41 before SgDQ would be a good thing
2015-07-06 04:40:27	onooboo	glad OpieOP

2015-07-06 04:40:41	orcastraw	but i also had nobody else to watch
2015-07-06 04:40:41	iztikeit	I mean if I show up at my job and suck because I'm drunk or hungover...
2015-07-06 04:40:49	themaster627	confirmed puncay getting new WR at SGDQ during their race
2015-07-06 04:40:49	saucepan47	if puncay is the mango of sm64 and cheese is the leffen, what is simply?
2015-07-06 04:40:53	copterskates	Have we discussed moist cocks yet?

2015-07-06 04:41:43	akgamer_01	EVERYBODY LOVES HIM
2015-07-06 04:41:45	lustghoul	simply is hbox cause his inhales are as annoying as hbox's popoffs

2015-07-06 04:41:59	sandbagx	Simply gonna get DQd at SG DQ
2015-07-06 04:41:59	presto1234	Puncay has tired of SM64, his career of running it is over.
2015-07-06 04:42:04	poon29	it's now just based on luck
2015-07-06 04:42:05	ruming2112	So that is a no?
2015-07-06 04:42:06	themaster627	i'd think practice on later stages is worth it to not get rusty since you never get there, which is what racing is good for too

2015-07-06 23:20:56	therealarkis	@Demolesher988 The title should read :600 star race with cheese05. raising money for sgdq as well!" in black text at the top.

2015-07-06 23:21:43	therealarkis	@Xhoshikox So you're not a mod who would mute or ban people making reference to the crotch cam? You're different to the other mods...

2015-07-06 23:24:15	xhoshikox	What
2015-07-06 23:24:21	themrsa	japanese text is faster
2015-07-06 23:24:21	phamilyman	loving this crotch cam
2015-07-06 23:24:33	electriceaterzx	@demolesher988 Its Japanese brah
2015-07-06 23:24:47	therealarkis	Oh, yeah, is that what you mean?
2015-07-06 23:25:00	therealarkis	Yeah ALL speedrunners run the Japanese version.
2015-07-06 23:25:07	quake2jb	why?
2015-07-06 23:25:14	jerrif	because its faster
2015-07-06 23:25:14	piepusher11	faster
2015-07-06 23:25:14	demolesher988	@electriceaterzx thanks and @therealarkis ya
2015-07-06 23:25:15	chyaddo	slightly faster
2015-07-06 23:25:20	therealarkis	It's for consistency.
2015-07-06 23:25:21	quake2jb	less dialog?
2015-07-06 23:25:22	themrsa	sup puncay. i wish i could watch this whole stream but I'm going to bed. I enjoy your commentary always
2015-07-06 23:25:23	electriceaterzx	Japanese text scroll faster
2015-07-06 23:25:43	jerrif	japanese text is more condensed
2015-07-06 23:25:44	herbivaur	Also, the text content doesn't matter in this game
2015-07-06 23:25:59	therealarkis	The idea is that ALL speedrunners need to run on the same platform so the times are immediately comparable.
2015-07-06 23:26:02	expandedidea	pundankmeme
2015-07-06 23:26:17	quake2jb	makes sense 
2015-07-06 23:26:24	iztikeit	Actually if someone broke wr with any other version it would still count
2015-07-06 23:26:25	chyaddo	they will still be going when i wake up
2015-07-06 23:26:46	therealarkis	The reason they chose the Japanese version over the English version is that it's slightly faster, sure, but I'm guessing it has something to do with the games origins as well, but I honestly am not sure.
2015-07-06 23:26:50	themrsa	i will check at 6am so i hope i catch the end lol
2015-07-06 23:26:53	v1nc3b	that is something only viewers care about lol....its the journey to self improvement...not a dick measuring contest
2015-07-06 23:27:09	naclg	How many runs is 600 stars?

2015-07-07 00:09:56	mopfjes	it was in a humble bundle and my friend gave me their turbo

2015-07-07 00:10:36	therealarkis	@Warbasket STOP! RIGHT NOW! You go get your N64 and you finish it RIGHT NOW! This is literally a staple in gaming. Yeah, it's a good game, but it's also a history lesson (at this point) and a great lesson in level design and game mechanics!
2015-07-07 00:10:40	lisafrankgirl	smash that cheese fag puncay
2015-07-07 00:10:47	mopfjes	oh I have plenty of disposable money, it's just that none of the streamers I watch play many ads so it would benefit twitch way more than the streamers ;^;
2015-07-07 00:11:12	warbasket	but we sold my n64 for 150 dollas to some 50 year old man like 7 years ago q.q

2015-07-07 01:29:44	therealarkis	@Gull_ssbm That's assuming there's no variables like restarting a run or a change in rules, which considering it's Puncay is a high chance; so my question is still valid; good try, skank

2015-07-07 01:29:53	linka7x	Didnt know dat

2015-07-07 01:32:02	g_heinz	good for the game
2015-07-07 01:32:09	mal1t1a	Why does the game do this when you pick up a bomb-omb backwards?
2015-07-07 01:32:14	mal1t1a	Is it because it tried to read the name forwards?

2015-07-07 01:33:26	therealarkis	@Gull_ssbm Restarting at the start could alter the over-all timer, technically unless handled perfectly. Also, no worries, it's puncay stream, I didn't figure there was a dick around here; other than THAT CROTCH CAM! Kappa

2015-07-07 01:42:48	therealarkis	In that last 12 months Mango has done nothing but elevate the scene around smash. He brings so much hype, it's unreal; more than most who just show up fight and leave; we NEED more people like Mango, like him or not.

2015-07-07 01:52:54	dokuroman	Puncay has a stereotypical hipstur voice.
2015-07-07 01:52:55	zen_machine	Biinnys_bazooka yeah it's totally fine for him to use drugs to get an advantage lol

2015-07-07 01:53:19	therealarkis	Puncay can only beat WR if he does practice!
2015-07-07 01:53:19	mal1t1a	Are you doing a 4th run or no?

2015-07-07 01:54:33	bewtsykawlins	dont worry boys OpieOP  successfully made cheese feel guilty
2015-07-07 01:54:39	mal1t1a	She makes around $500+ on estimated sub count alone.
2015-07-07 01:54:41	milfmaster3000	or just get someone who isn't a little bitch
2015-07-07 01:54:46	jfg_	Why did cheese leave?

2015-07-07 01:54:58	unc2	because cheese is bad

2015-07-07 01:55:29	mal1t1a	"casually"
2015-07-07 01:55:34	thesingular1ty	puncayshun, she's a Dota 2 canwhore that somehow isn't banned yet
2015-07-07 01:55:40	biinnys_bazooka	@zen_machine nigga plz There is no proof Westballz used addy. Maybe he used it cuz of a disorder but not during tournament
2015-07-07 01:55:48	ragebringerrr	lmfao bunni?
2015-07-07 01:55:50	biinnys_bazooka	Bring some proof nigga
2015-07-07 01:55:51	therealarkis	@Puncayshun I say keep going, it's good practice, and next run you can get a friend with you,
2015-07-07 01:56:02	gigantor3	why did cheese quit?
2015-07-07 01:56:03	zen_machine	Biinnys_bazooka ahahaha ok just keep thinking Hax and Westballz don't abuse adderall
2015-07-07 01:56:04	biinnys_bazooka	Or people think ur as dumb as mango's gf
2015-07-07 01:56:04	ragebringerrr	the pleb status is real Kappa
2015-07-07 01:56:11	palaceer	adderral helps you focus but it doesnt suddenly make you the best player in the world, if you don't have ADD it basically just acts like any other stimulant 
2015-07-07 01:56:12	dokuroman	Twitch doesn't ban them because they make money off camwhores. Ad revenue is a brilliant thing.
2015-07-07 01:56:18	bewtsykawlins	@puncayshun, pls take WR asap, you are obviously the better player
2015-07-07 01:56:31	therealarkis	Mango is too awesome to have a dumb GF, if she's dumb it's because Mango wants her to be.
2015-07-07 01:56:35	mal1t1a	That video never gets old Kamehahahahaha 
2015-07-07 01:56:42	kamehahahahaha	That video at 26seconds is the funniest thing Ive ever seen on Twitch, the fuck is the matter with you lmaaao

2015-07-07 01:57:04	stevehdd	Stop talking about other ppls personal lives... None of your business
2015-07-07 01:57:06	p4ppy99	@puncayshun call Siglemic and ask him to join after this run
2015-07-07 01:57:10	unc2	no its not
2015-07-07 01:57:14	unc2	own up to your loss
2015-07-07 01:57:27	therealarkis	@Puncayshun Well it would help if he said something, to be fair.
2015-07-07 01:57:34	zonkpunch	speedrunners are pretty soft
2015-07-07 01:57:38	milfmaster3000	fuck that. He
2015-07-07 01:57:41	av11k	it's called owning your shiz
2015-07-07 01:57:44	panzearon	So what's the plan now? complete the 600 thing alone?
2015-07-07 01:57:48	stevehdd	Yeah cheese should have taken the loss
2015-07-07 01:57:49	supcom2	People are just shitposting
2015-07-07 01:57:52	therealarkis	@Zonkpunch Oh, you're a speed runner?
2015-07-07 01:57:58	s4mch4m	Zen_Machine, u think hax abuses addy?
2015-07-07 01:58:00	grandcathedral	sometimes I jsut want the internet ta turn off

2015-07-07 01:58:32	biinnys_bazooka	You have zero proof he abuses addy for matches
2015-07-07 01:58:32	zen_machine	Biinnys_bazooka using them to get an advantage in a tournament is abusive with regard to the competitive nature of a tournament
2015-07-07 01:58:34	biinnys_bazooka	Nigga

2015-07-07 01:59:47	saucepan47	westballz should smoke some meth before evo
2015-07-07 01:59:51	therealarkis	@Puncayshun Then fuck it, quit it and wait for back up, you're just teasing us otherwise.
2015-07-07 01:59:52	eks_0	Ill skype you and give you motivation Puncay

2015-07-07 02:00:32	isiperono	1
2015-07-07 02:00:35	ruming2112	Okay you play a game for hours and hours perfecting every single little bit of it and then you make a big mistake. It effects you as a person it's like you have failed at do something that you have practiced for what months, years and sometimes it's to much to handle so you take a break
2015-07-07 02:00:48	milfmaster3000	fuck that
2015-07-07 02:01:03	milfmaster3000	he knew this race was all in good fun and he ruined it
2015-07-07 02:01:07	mal1t1a	I play Dota 2, I know what that's like.
2015-07-07 02:01:34	kapl0w	that doesnt only apply to speedrunning
2015-07-07 02:01:35	vinqulum	that totally doesnt happen in other things in life ever
2015-07-07 02:01:36	mal1t1a	I have 4000+ hours of Dota 2 BibleThump
2015-07-07 02:01:39	stealthyduc	shouldnt have taken a break to play runescape
2015-07-07 02:01:42	ihgkowz	Chess50 has had a rough few days with SM64. I think it might have been a tad irresponsible to tackle the 600 star in his current shape, but tbh its just a 600 star and its not a big deal. I just hope he feels better tomorrow punWaifu
2015-07-07 02:01:49	biinnys_bazooka	What is cheese whining about? He has the WR ffs DansGame DansGame DansGame
2015-07-07 02:01:57	stugbug	guys... people quit races all the time.
2015-07-07 02:01:59	unc2	lmao if u guys are just gonna quit out of these 600 star races then just dont do them
2015-07-07 02:02:03	eks_0	MILF you just dont get it lol. I've been running for like a year and i put so much time into Ocarina of Time and its so fucking depressing to play bad when you shoudl be playing good.,
2015-07-07 02:02:03	stugbug	in every game
2015-07-07 02:02:09	curticus2	the game i speedrun is randomly generated, and i'm 11 seconds off wr, i can probably understand :P
2015-07-07 02:02:23	awakencloud	cheese is saying on his stream he's super depressed
2015-07-07 02:02:25	milfmaster3000	I ran for all last year too. I wouldnt give up in a fun race tho
2015-07-07 02:02:28	spectrexs	"MILFmaster3000" that's such a good name
2015-07-07 02:02:30	milfmaster3000	nerd
2015-07-07 02:02:35	milfmaster3000	thx bruh
2015-07-07 02:02:36	eks_0	Speedrunning is like
2015-07-07 02:02:45	eks_0	One of the funnest yet most depressing things in the world.
2015-07-07 02:03:07	raginglakitu	I don't run but I get the feeling from athletics. You practice a lot and if you don't do it right it pisses you off.
2015-07-07 02:03:12	pr0se	if ug et depressed over a video game u should probly not play the video game KappaPride
2015-07-07 02:03:12	spectrexs	any thing that you do for a long time over and over will be good sometimes and annoying some times
2015-07-07 02:03:23	spectrexs	it's all about keeping the mind attitude straight
2015-07-07 02:03:26	spectrexs	positivity
2015-07-07 02:03:31	stealthyduc	your gonna have a bad time
2015-07-07 02:03:33	ihgkowz	Playing bad when you're capable of much better and have done much better is mental torture. I'll hit slumps in Osu! and just have to grind out plays to keep myself in shape and to improve in general, but going a week or so straight of bad play is just agonizing
2015-07-07 02:03:34	curticus2	@Pr0se,  it's probably not just the game OMGScoots
2015-07-07 02:03:38	raginglakitu	@pr0se it's not that. It's the competitive nature of the person. If you know you CAN do well and don't you get upset
2015-07-07 02:03:40	stevehdd	@raginglakitu yeah but you still have to finish the race/game/match. You can't just quit
2015-07-07 02:03:46	eks_0	Like i get so sad if i fail Grotto Hover in Majora's Mask 
2015-07-07 02:03:50	kapl0w	you have to try to remember why you find something fun, everything you do too much becomes a chore at some point
2015-07-07 02:03:55	s4mch4m	ayyy that no fall damage was slick
2015-07-07 02:03:57	raginglakitu	Yes I completely agree stevehdd
2015-07-07 02:04:07	lisafrankgirl	nah he just a lil bitch, its the same with athletics
2015-07-07 02:04:11	raginglakitu	I'm not saying he SHOULD have quit.
2015-07-07 02:04:12	sionar	frustration is a feeling that is only known to speedrunners
2015-07-07 02:04:15	daeeedal	which run is this out of the 5?
2015-07-07 02:04:17	sionar	you guys just dont understand
2015-07-07 02:04:20	raginglakitu	And no Lisa, you're completely wrong lol
2015-07-07 02:04:29	lisafrankgirl	oh ok
2015-07-07 02:04:31	stevehdd	@raginglakitu I know I'm agreeing with you
2015-07-07 02:04:32	daeeedal	oh nvm I see the second timer
2015-07-07 02:04:33	sionar	Kappa
2015-07-07 02:04:44	lisafrankgirl	cause youre an athlete right raging lakitu
2015-07-07 02:04:45	stealthyduc	to college?
2015-07-07 02:04:51	ihgkowz	Playing Rhythm games & speed running have the unfortunate aspect of exact times and numbers you're competing to improve. When you are doing worse you are doing worse. Can't wing it or rely on other people's fuck ups to "win".
2015-07-07 02:04:55	jona__98	Im back to harass puncay
2015-07-07 02:04:56	raginglakitu	Yeah I've been a swimmer for 6 years.
2015-07-07 02:05:05	based_cat	that's embarrasing
2015-07-07 02:05:17	mal1t1a	I wish I could swim as good as mario.
2015-07-07 02:05:23	jim_the_destroyer	athletics and speedrunning share some connections but not the omes your talking about lisa
2015-07-07 02:05:27	unc2	puncay u made the negative comment
2015-07-07 02:05:29	ihgkowz	Also Chess50 has the added pressure of currently being "#1" with his WR. That puts pressure on him and it really makes an already tough situation of being in a slump even more tough.
2015-07-07 02:05:33	vinqulum	i play like shit 100% of the time im playing video games
2015-07-07 02:05:36	matthew_36	@RagingLakitu sup swim bro
2015-07-07 02:05:38	awakencloud	cheese quit, thats super sad and kid no ?
2015-07-07 02:05:46	milfmaster3000	literally EVERYONE knows that feeling lol
2015-07-07 02:05:47	mal1t1a	I wish I knew what it was like to stream for more than 1 viewer consistently BibleThump
2015-07-07 02:05:49	wayssa	im going through that in counter-strike right now tbh
2015-07-07 02:05:55	lisafrankgirl	dont know what swimming is like but i do know what technique is like in weightlifting
2015-07-07 02:06:03	stevehdd	@wayssa yep lol

It is not malicious in that people think you're "a dick" Kappa

2015-07-08 02:54:08	ihgkowz	I think my soda taste is different. I prefer water over soda and TBH sprite is only tolerable because its just sweet without much of a taste I guess. Coke, pepsi, hell even lemonade all have a distinct "taste" if that makes sense

2015-07-08 02:55:14	ihgkowz	I also think my soda taste was ruined by having primarily 7-up as a soda option as a kid. It's literally just super fizzy water with a tinge of sweet. Having only a can of 7up after a 100 degree day for months fucking blows. Water all the way

2015-07-08 04:16:03	ihgkowz	SM64 is hard to speedrun. Like WaveDashing in Melee, each SM64 speed runner is performing a "boot loop" every time they move forward. It gives Mario extra speed and jump distance by clicking Z, L, R together followed by A -> B -> L -> A -> B -> L -> B -> A. This is repeated a few thousand times a run.

2015-07-08 04:34:02	ihgkowz	"Teh URN" is actually a phrase whose origin comes from a legendary SM64 run gone awry from missing sixty nine front sub hops in a row. A man named "Teh" who played SM64 on an Urn graced this game community for only a few months before this disastrous event transpired. In honor of what was meant to be people now shout "TEH URN!" He was on 1:38:00 pace.

2015-07-08 04:57:11	ihgkowz	Puncayshun can do it. He will do it. He is the strength of the people embodied in the hat of justice atop the plumpy shouting leprechaun that is Mario. If anyone can make a demon midget in blue overalls bend his appendages in just the right way to take the gold and return bald eagles and hamburgers to America it is puncayshun.

Someone has made a business out of snatching Koopas in the night and taking them to Bowser evil laboratory to strip them of their life line then stuff the goods in gravity defying treasure cubes. And for what purpose? Mario uses them to dismantle the Bowser empire. Bowser's Take Over Toadstool Kingdom 100% PB needs work

Was Bowser planning on blowing up his own clock fortress to slow down Mario? Maybe he was going to blow it up after his defeat and spin the story to blame Peach. TTC was an inside job deIlluminati

2015-07-10 03:13:57	dafees	I don't know anyone who watches wrestling today that doesn't miss Punk. What annoys me is the way WWE is just shitting all over their diva's division. They let AJ get the longest title reign and now WWE is sort of trying to erase that in light of what has happened with her and Punk both leaving
2015-07-10 03:14:01	ocarinaisoverrated	and you cant say im bandwagon ive watched EVERY game from the last 5 years

2015-07-10 03:20:47	asylumsmash	Melee will probably get the most viewers this year
2015-07-10 03:20:49	icebaginjury	smash 4 is a game that piggy backed on the sucess of melee

2015-07-10 03:22:56	icebaginjury	melee is actually extremely fucking technical
2015-07-10 03:23:00	untitledproject	3s takes skill and is a legit fighting game

2015-07-10 03:23:10	healthycyan1de	all this arguing over a game being more technical than another is giving me my virginity back

2015-07-10 03:23:21	icebaginjury	melee takes a ton of skill, the options and decision trees are way more broad than a traditional fighter
2015-07-10 03:23:23	untitledproject	marvel 2 is more technical than smash

2015-07-10 03:24:12	oyoll	thats your opinion untitleproject 
2015-07-10 03:24:13	l0wg0	smash is like its own genre 
2015-07-10 03:24:24	icebaginjury	its not a traditional fighter at all, i would put in as like a sandbox fighting game, something like that, its in a league of its own
2015-07-10 03:24:36	icebaginjury	you cant really compare it to traditional fighters
2015-07-10 03:24:36	untitledproject	i mean i guess

2015-07-10 03:24:48	untitledproject	the way i see it smash just got competitive in spite of itself
2015-07-10 03:24:51	yoshinumberone	smash has its own category
2015-07-10 03:24:52	icebaginjury	but i wouldnt say its a bad game, or undeserving of being at evo
2015-07-10 03:25:02	jadentort	Hi
2015-07-10 03:25:03	icebaginjury	welll smash wasnt meant to be competitive
2015-07-10 03:25:03	andy7236	??????????????
2015-07-10 03:25:06	neptuneguy	It did, but that doesn't -not- make it a fighting game
2015-07-10 03:25:07	shehzman89	Nintendo is irrelevant look at the other game developers releasing broken games
2015-07-10 03:25:09	cloudy714	Did puncay get wr?
2015-07-10 03:25:11	icebaginjury	but the community did it themselves

2015-07-10 03:28:26	neptuneguy	Melee is so much more complicated than traditional fighters because there aren't usually set combos. You always have to adapt and make reads to even keep a combo going
2015-07-10 03:28:29	icebaginjury	no one, but im not saying street fighter is an easy game at all
2015-07-10 03:28:35	ncstove	Just do a no reset for practice
2015-07-10 03:28:35	shehzman89	for pc I feel getting a high end graphics card for gaming is unnecessary

2015-07-10 03:42:53	voyagingrs	The way to think about it is, our reality is ALREADY virtual because our brains create a model of the world. "Technological" VR will just allow us to choose what we experience rather than whatever our surroundings are
2015-07-10 03:42:56	flexxlordaladdin	It will definitely be better than real sex. You can fuck things that don't even exist. Let that sink in for a moment

2015-07-10 03:45:24	keasezu	easily the most thrilling gameplay ive ever seen
2015-07-10 03:45:26	untitledproject	use this as a guideline
2015-07-10 03:45:33	daralii	The Xbox will end when they stop selling
2015-07-10 03:45:34	rkazmer	this is the run i can feel it
2015-07-10 03:45:37	mamalde59140	ok lol
2015-07-10 03:45:47	untitledproject	360 games are still outselling xbone
2015-07-10 03:45:51	processingerror	Xbox already stopped selling like 6 years ago lol
2015-07-10 03:45:53	untitledproject	the 360 just needs to die
2015-07-10 03:45:56	the_blacklord	they xboned themselves lol
2015-07-10 03:45:58	daralii	Well yeah, there's nothing ON the Xbone

2015-07-10 03:46:19	shehzman89	I'm back
2015-07-10 03:46:21	untitledproject	xbone failed because it tried to be more than a game console
2015-07-10 03:46:26	doughnuthero	^
2015-07-10 03:46:27	voyagingrs	i went with PS4, very pleased
2015-07-10 03:46:29	yoshinumberone	they are purposely still releashing games on that thing
2015-07-10 03:46:33	untitledproject	@Shehzman89 http://pcpartpicker.com/p/6XDXzy check out my parts list
2015-07-10 03:46:35	processingerror	Like s PS3? Just saying.
2015-07-10 03:46:37	keasezu	wii u also pretty shit so far. ps4 only decent new gen
2015-07-10 03:46:41	ktmjkl	puncay yawning :D
2015-07-10 03:46:43	the_blacklord	xbox was doomed to die as soon as they moved from the cod shooter fanbase to kinect focus
2015-07-10 03:46:46	icebaginjury	I think things like human perception, emotings, and senses are often over looked as having to do with AI, but they are very relavent to developing real self aware AI.
2015-07-10 03:46:47	flexxlordaladdin	bloodbourne is mediocre ;)

2015-07-10 03:47:09	benjithecat_	thanks
2015-07-10 03:47:10	daralii	Biggest problem with the WiiU is that Nintendo still can't get third party devs to make shit for their consoles.
2015-07-10 03:47:12	icebaginjury	and 360 games are outselling Xbox 1
2015-07-10 03:47:14	dafees	@keasezu, lol for thinking Wii U = new / next gen
2015-07-10 03:47:16	voyagingrs	@IceBagInjury, agree, I think the singularity ppl greatly overestimate the requirements for human-level AGI
2015-07-10 03:47:18	processingerror	Fallout on PC will be 100x better unless something DRASTICALLY changes
2015-07-10 03:47:22	keasezu	is it not?
2015-07-10 03:47:23	projectrealitym	360 focused on games last time and they did better now it reversed and sony is doing better
2015-07-10 03:47:23	stugbug	No mic?
2015-07-10 03:47:29	voyagingrs	underestimate*
2015-07-10 03:47:35	the_blacklord	yeah it did and then nintendo brought out all the good shit while playstation kept the higher specs but lacking titles
2015-07-10 03:47:38	shehzman89	Nice build
2015-07-10 03:47:38	yoshinumberone	it does have problems though
2015-07-10 03:47:41	kh_love21	I say do a run no mic no chat
2015-07-10 03:47:51	whatzgoodboy	Tbh Xbox 360 and PS3 could've lasted another 2-3 years
2015-07-10 03:47:54	daralii	PC will still have unmoderated modding for Fo4, it will remain king.
2015-07-10 03:48:02	jin0z	i did it in 3.1 hours T_T
2015-07-10 03:48:09	tehemomedic	Yooou suck. Jackass xD

2015-07-10 03:48:16	the_blacklord	yeah pc > all especially how games are heading towards
2015-07-10 03:48:16	untitledproject	*xeon over i5
2015-07-10 03:48:21	trainsgochuga	@stugbug he has a mic, he just salty
2015-07-10 03:48:24	untitledproject	i need it for my rendering work
2015-07-10 03:48:31	daralii	Now we just need consoles to stop holding PC back
2015-07-10 03:48:32	yoshinumberone	fallout 4 though Kreygasm
2015-07-10 03:48:33	keasezu	@Dafees Wii u came out only 12 months before the other two consoles. I'd say thats close enough 
2015-07-10 03:48:33	shehzman89	But @untitledproject u use dual monitors correct
2015-07-10 03:48:36	untitledproject	besides a xeon is an i7 without the iGPU
2015-07-10 03:48:36	stugbug	ah okay, thanks
2015-07-10 03:48:42	shehzman89	Also how's the pc any issues?
2015-07-10 03:48:45	voyagingrs	how are consoles holding PC back?
2015-07-10 03:48:46	neptuneguy	Consoles don't hold PC back, shitty devs do
2015-07-10 03:48:53	neptuneguy	can't blame the console. lol
2015-07-10 03:48:58	stugbug	so i take it runs havent been great tonight?
2015-07-10 03:49:03	untitledproject	@Shehzman89 yeah i do, theres like 6 output ports on the 970
2015-07-10 03:49:04	the_blacklord	ninty say the future and tried to invent ways for consoles to stay relevant
2015-07-10 03:49:06	flexxlordaladdin	All the cross platform compatibility fixes DEFINITELY made them hold back on FO4
2015-07-10 03:49:07	processingerror	Yeah it's still way better looking than FO3 or FNV tho. Those looked even worse for the time.
2015-07-10 03:49:08	ferrero64	i blame console
2015-07-10 03:49:08	breadss	come on!

2015-07-10 03:49:20	the_blacklord	its not the consoles fault
2015-07-10 03:49:21	rkazmer	ive always wondered, is there any particular reason the run starts when the system is turned on and not when you click on the file?
2015-07-10 03:49:22	dadotjadot	That was a salty sounding reset...
2015-07-10 03:49:23	the_blacklord	its the audiences
2015-07-10 03:49:28	dafees	As a PC gamer I look forward to Doom, Mirror's Edge Catalyst, No Man's Sky and Fallout 4
2015-07-10 03:49:28	daralii	Sony/Microsoft have been known to include clauses that prohibit the PC version of games from looking too much better than the Xbone/PS4 versions, which have vastly inferior hardware.
2015-07-10 03:49:30	the_blacklord	they buy massively on consoles
2015-07-10 03:49:30	ferrero64	GL with the runs man

While a machine can do a single repeated task more efficently than a human, if often requires years of programming and a team of humans to consistently moniotor is, as humans we can do multiple things very skillfully, most of it without even thinking. but then again, were all just living in a hologram anyways Kappa Kappa Kappa Kappa jk

2015-07-10 03:53:43	panzey	gtx 970 is a powerhouse i love mine, there's an r9 390 that just came out tho and idk how hot it runs but it's double the RAM as the 970
2015-07-10 03:53:54	cheese05	70 star is
2015-07-10 03:53:55	palaceer	SFV looks freaking sweet
2015-07-10 03:53:55	untitledproject	r9 390 is a power whore tho lol

2015-07-10 03:54:05	tehemomedic	PJSalt
2015-07-10 03:54:05	untitledproject	kens got run cancels for days
2015-07-10 03:54:07	yoshinumberone	i like portal wheres that next game DansGame
2015-07-10 03:54:08	tehemomedic	PJSalt ?
2015-07-10 03:54:09	daralii	I really hope Capcom doesn't Capcom all over SFV
2015-07-10 03:54:12	untitledproject	just poke into a mixup
2015-07-10 03:54:18	hodorsdanglingmeat	His voice reminds me a lot of squidward
2015-07-10 03:54:19	flash_l180	this game will never be over
2015-07-10 03:54:20	projectrealitym	SFV looks worse tbh
2015-07-10 03:54:27	ferrero64	dude dont abandon the wii u
2015-07-10 03:54:28	the_blacklord	@Flash_L180 he restarts until he gets a good run going. His goal is to beat his time so if he is too far behind its optimal to just retry rather than keep going when its harder to beat the time
2015-07-10 03:54:29	doughnuthero	@Daralii dont expect too much from Capcom
2015-07-10 03:54:30	projectrealitym	Seems like a bunch of footsies
2015-07-10 03:54:31	fyaskoi	lirikCHAMP lirikCHAMP lirikCHAMP
2015-07-10 03:54:35	untitledproject	c.mk run cancel into either an overhead, throw, or low 
2015-07-10 03:54:36	ferrero64	splatoon is pretty good
2015-07-10 03:54:37	palaceer	SF4 was a good game but flawed imo, some of the mechanics were awful
2015-07-10 03:54:39	bden19	if you like portal you should get the free mod
2015-07-10 03:54:42	untitledproject	dude
2015-07-10 03:54:43	neptuneguy	I'm squidward, you're squidward
2015-07-10 03:54:45	bden19	that just came out

2015-07-10 03:54:47	dafees	@YoshiNumberOne, If you haven't already you should check out Portal Stories: Mel an awesome free to play Portal 2 mod
2015-07-10 03:54:48	shehzman89	I have Splatoon it's AWEOSME
2015-07-10 03:54:49	palaceer	yeah footsies are what makes SF4 fun imo
2015-07-10 03:54:53	yoshinumberone	cool
2015-07-10 03:54:53	untitledproject	Super SF4 was ResidentSleeper
2015-07-10 03:54:54	hodorsdanglingmeat	We're all squidward
2015-07-10 03:54:57	daralii	Ken's design looks awful in SFV
2015-07-10 03:55:01	untitledproject	AE was the best version imo
2015-07-10 03:55:04	projectrealitym	I hate footsies lol I just like going in
2015-07-10 03:55:04	palaceer	yeah super was bad
2015-07-10 03:55:08	ferrero64	splatoon is a good game
2015-07-10 03:55:08	untitledproject	broken characters make fighting games fun
2015-07-10 03:55:16	yoshinumberone	like ryu
2015-07-10 03:55:23	untitledproject	ryu was solid mid tier in AE
2015-07-10 03:55:23	ferrero64	last new great game from nintendo since a link between worlds
2015-07-10 03:55:25	unicorncp	bullshit
2015-07-10 03:55:26	icyyy_	Splatoon made insane sales its opening week lol
2015-07-10 03:55:27	untitledproject	yun tho Kreygasm
2015-07-10 03:55:28	projectrealitym	Thats why I liked marvel @untitledproject

2015-07-10 03:55:39	shehzman89	I'm leaning more towards keeping the 760
2015-07-10 03:55:43	voyagingrs	are there any other squidwards I should know about?
2015-07-10 03:55:43	daralii	No real reason to play Ryu when ERyu exists
2015-07-10 03:55:43	nasoodolol	splatoon is such a good game but i don't play it much because no mouse+keyboard controls
2015-07-10 03:55:43	untitledproject	@Projectrealitym i played marvel 2 heavy back in the day in the competitive scene
2015-07-10 03:55:53	palaceer	scarred for life because of yun tbh 
2015-07-10 03:55:54	ktmjkl	what was wrong with that one?
2015-07-10 03:55:54	projectrealitym	Marvel 2 Kreygasm
2015-07-10 03:55:54	nasoodolol	if splatoon had mouse+keyboard controls i'd play it all day everyday
2015-07-10 03:55:57	untitledproject	@Daralii best game ever
2015-07-10 03:55:58	thecrispy22	yogl
2015-07-10 03:56:01	whatzgoodboy	Marvel 2 was a competitive game
2015-07-10 03:56:04	pizzabrood	I have never seen puncay this inconcistend
2015-07-10 03:56:04	whatzgoodboy	Best imo
2015-07-10 03:56:10	thekeg1108	why the reset??
2015-07-10 03:56:13	dafees	just play the TF2 Splatoon mod?
2015-07-10 03:56:15	twitchnotify	Stugbug just subscribed!
2015-07-10 03:56:18	doughnuthero	ayyy
2015-07-10 03:56:19	yoshinumberone	not a fan of the keyboard+mouse
2015-07-10 03:56:21	pizzabrood	sub hype PogChamp
2015-07-10 03:56:22	projectrealitym	Haven't played it in forever, way better than marvel 3
2015-07-10 03:56:25	daralii	Marvel 2 was great. I'm amazed Marvel 3 still sees as much play as it does.
2015-07-10 03:56:29	the_blacklord	he did the hop to the island with a slightly bad angle i think so he reset
2015-07-10 03:56:30	unicorncp	ayy?
2015-07-10 03:56:33	pizzabrood	wait why would you sub when he plays like this Kappa
2015-07-10 03:56:41	doughnuthero	rood
2015-07-10 03:56:42	untitledproject	@Daralii you play Ryu>E,Ryu because his C.mk is a true blockstring with fireballs
2015-07-10 03:56:51	projectrealitym	Hopefully Marvel 3 is hype at evo
2015-07-10 03:56:53	shehzman89	But still I'm on the fence here I have all the major games for Wii u and think they're great
2015-07-10 03:57:01	untitledproject	@Daralii that and his footsies are faster, but e.ryu has heavier damage
2015-07-10 03:57:04	whatzgoodboy	Nothing can beat the old gen games since PS2 days
2015-07-10 03:57:07	roach788	funkHOYP
2015-07-10 03:57:08	snappytable4290	I want a wii fking u
2015-07-10 03:57:09	projectrealitym	I think IIRC there are gonna be MM's
2015-07-10 03:57:10	untitledproject	but why play ryu when you have ken
2015-07-10 03:57:14	stugbug	punWaifu punWaifu punWaifu punWaifu punWaifu punWaifu
2015-07-10 03:57:17	doughnuthero	i like my wii u
2015-07-10 03:57:20	voyagingrs	wii u is only good if you have irl friends BibleThump
2015-07-10 03:57:22	shehzman89	I do too
2015-07-10 03:57:25	doughnuthero	although i barely have any good games for it
2015-07-10 03:57:27	yoshinumberone	i do
2015-07-10 03:57:34	nasoodolol	i bought a wii u only for splatoon
2015-07-10 03:57:38	nasoodolol	i have no other games
2015-07-10 03:57:39	untitledproject	marvel 3 is always hype at evo
2015-07-10 03:57:43	snappytable4290	Prob grtting a new graphics card instead
2015-07-10 03:57:49	untitledproject	its jsut a matter of no zero's making top 8
2015-07-10 03:57:52	nasoodolol	but i don't play it because no mouse+keyboard
2015-07-10 03:57:56	shehzman89	Still idk if pc will do the job for me better
2015-07-10 03:58:00	miller57	wii u isnt good for anything now that smash sucked.
2015-07-10 03:58:04	the_blacklord	hypest console atm is 3ds tho :P such good games (mh, smash, etc)
2015-07-10 03:58:12	untitledproject	i honestly like the wii u
2015-07-10 03:58:15	untitledproject	it just has no games
2015-07-10 03:58:18	roach788	MvC3.... YOU Pressed the WRONG!!! Button!!!
2015-07-10 03:58:20	nasoodolol	splatoon is a game
2015-07-10 03:58:25	voyagingrs	mh?
2015-07-10 03:58:27	projectrealitym	You think Flocker or Flux or cloud will make it in top 8?
2015-07-10 03:58:29	miller57	wii u support going to die after they release zelda.
2015-07-10 03:58:30	the_blacklord	monster hunter

2015-07-10 03:58:53	veman3000	Chat is sooo chill, much love
2015-07-10 03:58:54	untitledproject	@Projectrealitym my predicted top  8 are apologyman, KBR, Chris G, Justin in winners
2015-07-10 03:59:04	nasoodolol	why did it take so long for people to figure out the zelda setup for cannonless
2015-07-10 03:59:16	untitledproject	@Projectrealitym Fullschedule, Flocker, Cloud and Angelic in losers
2015-07-10 03:59:27	voyagingrs	@Veman3000, <3

2016-04-08 04:23:17	xqclol	again dont kill me for this hut cosmo had big fame, played her hand extremelly poorly
2016-04-08 04:23:25	crashcat	mario camera is kind of trash when the level isn't designed with it in mind
2016-04-08 04:23:40	pieordie1	no
2016-04-08 04:23:41	farkinator	still reeks of attention seeking tho I don't know the person so I'm not particularly worried
2016-04-08 04:23:44	mal1t1a	If I was famous I would tell everyone it would be ok
2016-04-08 04:23:49	pieordie1	camera is trash for any SM64 hack lol
2016-04-08 04:23:52	mal1t1a	I would just go around saying: ":It will be ok"
2016-04-08 04:23:58	aussiegrit	What? You don't like money? avoidLol avoidLol avoidLol avoidLol
2016-04-08 04:24:06	issashine	xQcLoL, how did she play her hand poorly? by coming out? is that what you are saying? surely its not...
2016-04-08 04:24:15	mal1t1a	but I don't need to be famous to tell everyone that.
2016-04-08 04:24:20	mal1t1a	I just need to be a mod Kappa
2016-04-08 04:24:25	xqclol	no, thats not what i said not even close.

2016-04-08 04:25:06	chris_weidman_ufc	Does being a great speedrunner make this game any easier?
2016-04-08 04:25:07	issashine	xQcLoL, what else did she do after getting big that would cause this to happen then?
2016-04-08 04:25:07	m2005	CLUTCH :D
2016-04-08 04:25:17	xqclol	when ur famous living off ur stream. anything that involves ultimately deleting your channel and saying ur out of $ is playing the hand wrong... right? or should i say... wright? Kappa
2016-04-08 04:25:20	davidyagamez	The camera is totally prepared to watch you fall down and get swallowed up in the green stuff. It seemed almost eager to pan down
2016-04-08 04:25:21	midas_mulligan	this section reminds me of a part in jak and daxter
2016-04-08 04:25:26	aussiegrit	@puncayshun btw not tonight. But sometime next week I will seriously race you for cash. Don't be scared avoidLol avoidLol it's impossible I win punWaifu

2016-04-08 04:25:49	chris_weidman_ufc	Makes sense
2016-04-08 04:25:53	issashine	xQcLoL, its basically her job, people quit jobs that make them unhappy all the time. doesn't seem that strange.

2016-04-08 04:27:01	nayshunbot	Puncayshun's stream has a bingo! Check it out here: http://puncayshun.net/bingo/
2016-04-08 04:27:13	farkinator	cosmo just needs to become sexually identified as Captain Falcon and only communicate in YAHS twitch would love her then
2016-04-08 04:27:15	xqclol	seems like a reasonable point. altho I think it would be a leap of faith. use the fame for good and then leave it, instead of slowly killing it. idk, im not in her spot
2016-04-08 04:27:18	davidyagamez	Puncay, would you consider donating $5 to me every month so that I can afford to sub to you? Kappa
