You're leaning on that cane again
t's seems you're trying to hide the pain
ut let's just cut it down in size
         
           throw it up into the sky
too many unhappy people crying
buckets of rain again
snow is gone so why the fuck are we sitting here complaining?
I love you when you're happy
I love you when you're sad
But I'd rather be a retard babe
then be your motherfuckin' dad
telling you what to do.

take some medicine
get a bandage
shoot some heroin
see a therapist.
drink some tea
build a routine
walk down by the sea
ask for more or less.
