Crazy rides rockets
Who has a magic wand
Empty out your pockets
Words without a song

I myself have found
A real rival within myself
I am hoping for
A re-arrival of my health

Sleeping eye sockets
Baby, suck your thumb
I'll keep you in my locket
A string I never strum

It's become so obvious
You are so oblivious to yourself

Tied in a knot
But I'm not gonna get caught
Calling a pot kettle black
Every song is a comeback
Every moment's a little bit later

Lazy locomotives
Wherever you may roll
I think you have no motive
I know you have no home

It's become so obvious
You are so oblivious to yourself

Tied in a knot
But I'm not gonna get caught
Calling a pot kettle black
Every song is a comeback
Every moment's a little bit later
Every moment's a little bit later
Every moment's a little bit later
Every moment's a little bit later

Tied in a knot
But I'm not gonna get caught
Calling a pot kettle black...
