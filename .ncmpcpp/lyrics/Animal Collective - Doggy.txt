Dog of height in the trees
Won't you come down doggy?
Such a sweet doggy
I brought you your dinner
My doggy, I miss you kissing from my palm
I remember when I first got you doggy
Sweet doggy

You lay there so still dog
You lay there so still, dog
You lay there so still, dog

Dog who fell to the ground
Twisted your neck doggy
Don't look right doggy
The vet came with sutures
He said, "Dave, hey the doctor cannot save your dog"
But I remember when I first got you dog
Sweet doggy

You lay there so still dog
You lay there so still dog
You lay there so still dog
You lay there so still dog

Dog of depth in the dirt
They buried you deep doggy
You're the best doggy
My friend has a doggy
She's real nice dog, I wish you could chase her 'round my yard
I remember when I first got you dog
Sweet doggy

You lay there so still, dog
You lay there so still, dog
You lay there so still, dog
You lay there so still, dog

But you lay there so still, dog
But you lay there so still, dog
